However, while Delta stock isn't as egregiously undervalued today as it was in mid-2012, it still seems quite cheap in light of the company's recent earnings growth and substantial free cash flow.\",\n",

In effect, the pension plan contributions can reduce cash flow potentially negatively impacting a number investors look upon for valuing a company. This method is common in the airline industry, as it typically results in a lower interest rate than unsecured debt offers since creditors have a direct claim on an asset in the event of default.',\n",

Shareholders of American Airlines Group Inc (Symbol: AAL) looking to boost their income beyond the stock's 1% annualized dividend yield can sell the January 2017 covered call at the $57.50 strike and collect the premium based on the $2.23 bid, which annualizes to an additional 3.6% rate of return against the current stock price (at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost ), for a total of 4.6% annualized rate in the scenario where the stock is not called away. Any upside above $57.50 would be lost if the stock rises there and is called away, but AAL shares would have to climb 40.6% from current levels for that to occur, meaning that in the scenario where the stock is called, the shareholder has earned a 46.1% return from this trading level, in addition to any dividends collected before the stock was called.\",\n",

The company's beaten-down market cap of less than $2.6 billion doesn't reflect this potential whatsoever and creates huge upside for Spirit Airlines stock.\",\n",

In fact, Spirit\\'s costs are so low that its total average price (including extras and the company\\'s very high profit margin) is lower than its competitors\\' costs , as this chart shows: Spirit\\'s extremely low costs are driven by many factors: One type of plane and one class of service Cramming the maximum number of seats (~20% more) onto every plane by reducing legroom and having seats that don\\'t recline No seat-back pockets, wifi or entertainment systems All direct flights (no hub-and-spoke) A limited frequent flyer program Personnel who do multiple jobs (e.g., flight attendants who also clean the plane and act as gate agents) Turning aircraft quickly and flying at all hours, thereby maximizing daily flight time (12.7 hours/day for Spirit; 11.8 for JetBlue; 10.9 for Southwest) Rapid growth means lots of new airplanes, which reduces maintenance expense Every one of these factors, other than the last one, strikes me as sustainable - as Ryanair has proved. A quick Google search reveals endless stories that are summarized in this blurb in AirlineReporter.com: Heck, even my wife cringed when I told her I bought the stock, and when I disclosed this purchase to my investors, I felt compelled to write: \"I know, I know, it\\'s really horrible airline - but at least read my slides with an open mind.\"',\n",

Shareholders of American Airlines Group Inc (Symbol: AAL) looking to boost their income beyond the stock's 0.9% annualized dividend yield can sell the January 2018 covered call at the $60 strike and collect the premium based on the $3.65 bid, which annualizes to an additional 4% rate of return against the current stock price (at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost ), for a total of 4.9% annualized rate in the scenario where the stock is not called away. Any upside above $60 would be lost if the stock rises there and is called away, but AAL shares would have to climb 36.4% from current levels for that to happen, meaning that in the scenario where the stock is called, the shareholder has earned a 44.7% return from this trading level, in addition to any dividends collected before the stock was called.\",\n",

       "               'New_text': 'By Ben Axler : Report Entitled \" Sabre Corp : Slicing Estimates \" Spruce Point Capital Management is pleased to announce it has released the contents of a unique short idea involving Sabre Corp (NASDAQ: SABR ), a recycled LBO taken public in 2014 where we see $1200-$1700 per share, or approximately 40% to 60% downside Our presentation is accessible on our website wwwsprucepointcapcom We also encourage all of our readers to sign-up on our website and to follow us on Twitter @Sprucepointcap for exclusive research updates Please review our disclaimer at the end of our research report I Executive Summary Introducing Sabre Corp, An Old Investment Story Taken Public in 2014 after its LBO in 2007 Underlying Business Model Pressure Suggest Questionable Value Creation Sabre Corp is a travel tech company with a core business of operating a Global Distribution System (\"GDS\"), a platform that facilitates travel by bringing together content such as inventory, prices, and availability from a broad array of travel suppliers for a range of travel buyers such as online/physical travel agents and corporate travel departments Customers include American Airlines (NASDAQ: AAL ), United (NYSE: UAL ), Delta (NYSE: DAL ), and Air Canada ( OTCPK:ACDVF ) As a middleman between buyers and suppliers, Sabre\\'s biggest risk is disintermediation, whereby its consumers bypass its network, through emerging threats from Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) ( GOOGL ), or even worse, suppliers imposing fees to customers for using it (eg Lufthansa) To keep customers happy and loyal, Sabre must offer upfront cash incentives because its contracts are typically short term, and upwards of 20% of contracts renew annually Our research suggests that Sabre has been offering increasing incentive discounts, which has forced deflationary pricing as evident in declining revenue per transaction Sabre came public in 2014 after a highly promoted going private LBO in 2007 during the pre-financial crisis buyout mania Our research suggests that despite significant M&A and restructuring at Sabre while under private ownership, there has been no value creation in its underlying business, which has sorely disappointed expectations By ignoring the headline \"Adjusted\" EBITDA and EPS results and focusing on underlying cash flow economics, it\\'s evident that Sabre is at best a stagnant business Not surprisingly, Sabre\\'s two private equity sponsors have rapidly exited the stock through 4 secondary issuances, and reduced their ownership from 95% pre-IPO to 25% today! Not surprisingly, management\\'s cash bonuses, along with its sponsors\\' management fees, are solely linked to reported EBITDA This linkage provides clear incentives to game the EBITDA figures Valuation Disconnect Suggesting 40%-60% Downside : Smelling a fee bonanza from repeated equity and debt issuances, a grand total of 13 analysts all have \"Buy\" recommendations and see upside to an average price target of $3342 (+17%) In our opinion, it\\'s easy to refute the bull case from analysts flawed investment assumptions At approximately 34x and 105x 2016E Street sales and Adj EBITDA estimates, respectively, Sabre appears fairly valued to peers (on inflated street numbers) Amadeus ( OTCPK:AMADF ) and Travelport (NYSE: TVPT ) During the heavily touted LBO, venerated investment bankers at Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley issued a fairness opinion suggesting a terminal EBITDA multiple range of 65x-80x Given our belief that post-LBO, no underlying financial improvement has been created, and at worst accounting gimmicks are masking deterioration, we find it baffling how analysts can justify the current valuation Furthermore, analysts fail to adjust their models for Sabre\\'s $387m tax receivable liability that starts coming due in 2017 and has real cash flow implications We also adjust Sabre\\'s financials for the aggressive capitalization of recurring and normal upfront cash incentives As a result, we derive a long-term price target of $1200 - $1700 per share, or 40-60% downside II Brief Overview of Sabre Sabre Corp, headquartered in Southlake, TX comprises two segments: Travel Networks and Airline and Hospitality Solutions In 2015, the company reported total revenues of $29bn, Adj EBITDA of $941m, Adj Free Cash Flow of $299m, and Adj EPS of $110/share Sabre was taken private in 2007 by TPG and Silver Lake at a 30% premium for $3275/share, valuing the deal at approximately $50bn (including the assumption of $550m of net debt) and subsequently IPO\\'ed in April 2014 at $1600 per share, giving Sabre an enterprise value of $75bn With an 80% appreciation in the shares, Sabre\\'s market cap and enterprise value are $78bn and $113bn, respectively Travel Networks Segment 2015 Revenues of $2,102m and Adj EBITDA of $877m (71% of total revenue and 73% of total Adj EBITDA 1 ) Global business-to-business travel marketplace and consists primarily of its Global Distribution System (\"GDS\") and a broad set of solutions that integrate with its GDS to add value for travel suppliers and travel buyers GDS facilitates travel by bringing together travel content such as inventory, prices, and availability from a broad array of travel suppliers, including airlines, hotels, car rental brands, rail carriers, cruise lines and tour operators, with a large network of travel buyers, including online travel agencies (\"OTAs\"), offline travel agencies, travel management companies (\"TMCs\") and corporate travel departments Airline and Hospitality Solutions Segment: 2015 Revenues of $872m and Adj EBITDA of $323m (29% of total revenue and 27% of total Adj EBITDA (1)) Airline and Hospitality Solutions business offers a broad portfolio of software technology products and solutions, through software-as-a-service (\"SaaS\") and hosted delivery model, to airlines, hotel properties and other travel suppliers Airline and Hospitality Solutions aggregates Sabre\\'s Airline Solutions and Hospitality Solutions operating segments (1) pre-corporate overhead Capital and Debt Structure Sabre IPO\\'ed at $16/share in April 2014 Its aggressive leverage, reflective of a junk credit status with S&P and Moody\\'s, and its high valuation leave no margin for error in disappointing Wall Street\\'s analysts Note: We include the $387m book value of the Tax Receivable Agreement liability in our valuation It has near-term cash implications, with payments expected starting 2017 Other liabilities that could affect the valuation include $96m of pension liabilities and $102m representing the present value of operating leases Sabre has significant debt of $32bn ($36bn inc the TRA) and it has a $381m of available revolving credit as of 12/31/15 which expires in 2018/2019 (click to enlarge) (click to enlarge) Key Events Inflating Sabre\\'s Stock Price Sabre\\'s IPO priced well below the $18-$20 indicated range, but has appreciated +80% on the back of earnings increases, a debt refinancing, and selective M&A deals Our report will focus on the \"quality\" of Sabre\\'s earnings, especially in relation to the aggressive accounting for Sabre\\'s Abacus deal (click to enlarge) III Fundamental Short Thesis and Evidence Suggesting Limited/No Value Creation Post LBO Summary of Fundamental Concerns Sabre\\'s core Travel Network (GDS) business is under pressure while its transition to higher margin services is slow to materialize, and coming with substantial capex costs Furthermore, we believe little/no financial value has been created at Sabre Pre/Post its LBO in 2007 Key Issues Short-Term Contracts with Significant Renewal Risk : Contracts are typically structured for 1-3 years and a meaningful portion of travel buyer agreements typically representing 15%-20% of bookings are up for renewal in a given year! Furthermore, barriers cannot stop the disintermediation away from GDS that is occurring as evidenced by the Lufthansa news and Google\\'s entry in to the business Rebuttal: In our opinion, Sabre\\'s multiple should re-rate lower not higher!',\n",

Shareholders of American Airlines Group Inc (Symbol: AAL) looking to boost their income beyond the stock's 1.1% annualized dividend yield can sell the January 2018 covered call at the $47 strike and collect the premium based on the $2.75 bid, which annualizes to an additional 5.6% rate of return against the current stock price (at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost ), for a total of 6.7% annualized rate in the scenario where the stock is not called away. Any upside above $47 would be lost if the stock rises there and is called away, but AAL shares would have to advance 23.9% from current levels for that to occur, meaning that in the scenario where the stock is called, the shareholder has earned a 31.2% return from this trading level, in addition to any dividends collected before the stock was called.\",\n",

However, this will be partially offset by the company's non-fuel operating expenses, which are expected be on the higher end of the guidance range due to the recently ratified labor agreement with pilots and flight attendants.

Shareholders of American Airlines Group Inc (Symbol: AAL) looking to boost their income beyond the stock's 0.8% annualized dividend yield can sell the January 2019 covered call at the $65 strike and collect the premium based on the $3.15 bid, which annualizes to an additional 4% rate of return against the current stock price (at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost ), for a total of 4.8% annualized rate in the scenario where the stock is not called away. Any upside above $65 would be lost if the stock rises there and is called away, but AAL shares would have to advance 28.8% from current levels for that to happen, meaning that in the scenario where the stock is called, the shareholder has earned a 35% return from this trading level, in addition to any dividends collected before the stock was called.\",\n",

Below is a chart showing AAL's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $45.00 strike highlighted in red: Considering the fact that the $45.00 strike represents an approximate 8% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. Investors in American Airlines Group Inc (Symbol: AAL) saw new options begin trading this week, for the January 2021 expiration.\",\n",

The Philadelphia SE Semiconductor Index, under pressure in recent months after Apple Inc warned of waning smartphone demand, was on track for its biggest one-day percentage gain since Dec. 26, advancing 5.5 percent. Still, even in the face of upbeat corporate results, fears surrounding tariffs and the longest federal government shutdown in history weighed on investors.',\n",

The 5.3 percent drop in share price on Monday wiped nearly $13 billion off Boeing's market value - an abrupt reversal for a stock that had been the runaway top performer so far this year on the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Since U.S. stocks began rebounding from the 2007-09 financial crisis in March 2009, Boeing shares have delivered a total return - including reinvested dividends - of nearly 1,600 percent, or four times the performance of the full index.\",\n",

Boeing Co, the best performing Dow component this year by a wide margin, tumbled 11.5 percent in premarket trading, and appeared on track for its worst day in nearly two decades after many airlines grounded the company's new 737 MAX 8 passenger jet following the second deadly crash in just five months.

Possible links between the accidents have rocked the aviation industry, scared passengers, and left the world's biggest planemaker scrambling to prove the safety of a money-spinning model intended to be the standard for decades. A November preliminary report, before the retrieval of the cockpit voice recorder, focused on maintenance and training and the response of a Boeing anti-stall system to a recently replaced sensor, but gave no reason for the crash.\",\n",

Venezuela plunged into a deep political crisis in January when Juan Guaido, head of the opposition-controlled congress, invoked the constitution to assume an interim presidency, arguing Nicolas Maduro's 2018 re-election was not legitimate.\",\n",

Home improvement retailer Kingfisher shed 6.4 percent on its worst day in nearly a year after it reported lower full-year results and said it had started the process to find a replacement for its chief executive officer. Investors also awaited the U.S. Federal Reserve's policy decision, in which it is expected to hold interest rates steady, shave the number of hikes projected for the rest of the year, and detail a plan to end the monthly reduction of its balance sheet.\",\n",

Boeing, the world's largest planemaker, said the anti-stall system, which is believed to have repeatedly forced the nose lower in the accident in Indonesia last October, would only do so one time after sensing a problem, giving pilots more control.\",\n",

Some analysts had warned that prices could not sustain their high levels, particularly as auto sales have weakened in key markets including Europe and China, meaning car makers may need less metal. Investors were looking ahead to the latest round of China-U.S. trade negotiations in Beijing on Thursday, as well as a fraught week for the UK as Prime Minister Theresa May attempts to push through her twice-rejected Brexit deal.',\n",

The chart below shows the one year performance of AAL shares: Looking at the chart above, AAL's low point in its 52 week range is $28.81 per share, with $45.82 as the 52 week high point — that compares with a last trade of $30.23.\",\n",
