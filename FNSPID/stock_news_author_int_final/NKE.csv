New Article Just do it with Nike The aging Baby Boom generation has heightened awareness of the need for preventive efforts to maintain wellness and avoid injury and illness as people grow older. That has led to a revolution in the athletic apparel space, and longtime leader Nike has remained immensely successful even in the face of heightened competition in the fast-growing industry. Yet given its much-larger size, Nike has done a great job of staying ahead of the competition and using its scale to capitalize on growth opportunities that its peers can't find. New Article After calculating this multiple, investors can compare it to more established industry peers -- in this case, Nike (NYSE: NKE) -- and assess whether or not the multiple is sensible. One of the problems with analyzing growth stocks is that they often are not yet reporting consistent free cash flow or earnings per share, making it difficult to estimate what they are worth.

Shareholders of Nike (Symbol: NKE) looking to boost their income beyond the stock's 1.4% annualized dividend yield can sell the January 2019 covered call at the $60 strike and collect the premium based on the $3.60 bid, which annualizes to an additional 3.4% rate of return against the current stock price (at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost ), for a total of 4.8% annualized rate in the scenario where the stock is not called away. Any upside above $60 would be lost if the stock rises there and is called away, but NKE shares would have to climb 17.5% from current levels for that to happen, meaning that in the scenario where the stock is called, the shareholder has earned a 24.5% return from this trading level, in addition to any dividends collected before the stock was called.

Piper Jaffray's latest ""Taking Stock With Teens"" survey ranked Nike as the top apparel and footwear brand, while Adidas ranked third in both categories.

New Article Shares of NIKE Inc.NKE have soared 10.2% in the after-hours session, yesterday, as both earnings and sales topped estimates in fourth-quarter fiscal 2018. This was primarily driven by double-digit growth at international locations and global NKE Direct business as well as a return to growth in North America. NKE Direct grew 41%, with currency-neutral revenue growth of 34% in the fiscal fourth quarter. New Article As for individual stocks, investors applauded Nike 's (NYSE: NKE) strong earnings report, while Constellation Brands (NYSE: STZ) fell on weak profits. The growth in North America was a welcome development for investors, as was the acceleration of international sales and the announcement of a four-year, $15 billion share repurchase program. Operating income, however, managed only 4.5% growth due to planned marketing investments, higher transportation costs, and unfavorable currency effects. New Article In early trading on Friday, shares of Nike ( NKE ) topped the list of the day's best performing Dow Jones Industrial Average components, trading up 11.3%.

New Article Two other components making moves today are McKesson Corp ( MCK ), trading down 1.7%, and Nike ( NKE ), trading up 11.7% on the day. Year to date, Vertex Pharmaceuticals registers a 10.0% gain. And the worst performing S&P 500 component thus far on the day is Constellation Brands ( STZ ), trading down 6.6%. New Article Wall Street came off its highs but stayed stronger on Friday, capping the first half of the year with gains as earnings from blue-chip Nike ( NKE ) propped up the Dow Jones Industrial Average while advances in energy and industrials aided the Standard & Poor's 500.

And the worst performing Dow component thus far on the day is Chevron ( CVX ), trading down 1.8%. New Article Meanwhile, Nike (NYSE: NKE ) attracted a flood of call options activity after posting blowout fourth-quarter earnings. Nike (NKE) Nike stock rocketed more than 11% higher on Friday, and was pretty much the only reason the Dow finished in positive territory. NKE stock options traders chased Friday's rally. New Article In recent trading, shares of NIKE Inc (Symbol: NKE) have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $75.00, changing hands for $79.68/share. But the whole reason to look at the average NKE price target in the first place is to tap into a ""wisdom of crowds"" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with NKE crossing above that average target price of $75.00/share, investors in NKE have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $75.00 just one stop on the way to an even higher target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table? New Article Walmart ( WMT ) and Nike ( NKE ) led losses among the blue chips on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, while Goldman Sachs ( GS ) and Apple ( AAPL ) were among the gainers. Wall Street was mixed on Monday, paring losses into the close as gains in tech and financial stocks helped the measures slip into the green, even as the benchmarks were constrained by losses in energy and consumer names. The choppy session came amid continued worries about the impact of the trade dispute that deepened this week on the start of retaliatory tariffs on a number of US exports and talk from President Donald Trump about the World Trade Organization. New Article Particularly high volume was seen for the $79 strike call option expiring July 06, 2018 , with 1,628 contracts trading so far today, representing approximately 162,800 underlying shares of NKE. Below is a chart showing SYNT's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $40 strike highlighted in orange: And Nike (Symbol: NKE) options are showing a volume of 36,110 contracts thus far today. That number of contracts represents approximately 3.6 million underlying shares, working out to a sizeable 47.4% of NKE's average daily trading volume over the past month, of 7.6 million shares. New Article Nike ( NKE ) shed 1.7% as Roger Federer opened his title defense at Wimbledon title defense in a Uniqlo outfit, rather than Nike. And amid reports that Trump is looking to take the US out of the WTO, markets were digesting the leader's comments that he's not ""planning anything now"" but ""will be doing something"" if the body doesn't treat the country properly. Gainers outnumbers the decliners on the Dow by an almost two-to-one ratio, with Goldman Sachs ( GS ) and Microsoft ( MSFT ) rising while Walmart ( WMT ) weakened 1.9%.",113.55207824707031

Uniqlo, the leading subsidiary of Japan's Fast Retailing Co. , has inked a remarkable 10-year sponsorship deal with the 36-year-old athlete that isn't even predicated on his continuing to play. Bill Barker: Uniqlo is, I guess, the best-known of the brands under Fast Retailing, which is the parent company that you can invest in. New Article They also discuss the news that Roger Federer has left his lifelong sponsor Nike (NYSE: NKE) for a $300 million endorsement deal with Japanese apparel maker Uniqlo -- and why Nike was probably smart not to try to match it. In this MarketFoolery podcast, host Chris Hill and analyst Bill Barker take advantage of the slow holiday week to reply to some of their listeners' queries. Barker: What I think you need to do is extend an invitation to somebody from Mondelez for one of your many fine podcast and radio shows to talk through the serious business issues of your proposed strategy, which may be a value-creating one, but they may have somebody that would be able to educate you, like, ""This is why we're doing this."" New Article Twenty Dow stocks settled in the red, paced by a 2.6% drop for Nike ( NKE ). The Dow explored a 294-point range on both sides of breakeven during today's abbreviated session, as an early rally evaporated by the time the closing bell sounded.

Growth of 3% might not seem like a barn-burning quarter, but if you think about the amount of pessimism out there about sports apparel, I feel like investors probably thought, ""It's either going to be flat or down."" It's going to be very fascinating to see not only where Under Armour stands in North America, but also, are they working through this inventory snafu and getting the business back in the right direction.

New Article The backlash against Nike (NYSE: NKE) was probably predictable after it put controversial quarterback Colin Kaepernick at the center of a new ad campaign, celebrating the 30th anniversary of the company's ""Just Do It"" motto. LeBron James, perhaps the most famous American athlete, has embraced politics and activism, endorsing Hillary Clinton for president in 2016 and opening up a charter school in his hometown of Akron, Ohio. For example, when North Carolina passed an anti-LGBT bill in 2016, organizations including the NCAA, Deutsche Bank , and PayPal ditched plans they had to expand in the state. New Article Nike (NKE)’s controversial decision to make Colin Kaepernick the face of their latest ad campaign has upset a lot of people and pleased many others. On that basis, any weakness in NKE as this plays out is just an opportunity to buy the stock at a discount.

It's a fairly bold maneuver, and it's generating kudos and boos from exactly the places that anyone remotely tuned in to current events would expect. They've had celebrities or sports athletes who have ultimately moved the needle for them and caused a lot of stir, but it's usually for the benefit of Nike. New Article In recent trading, shares of NIKE Inc (Symbol: NKE) have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $80.32, changing hands for $80.40/share. But the whole reason to look at the average NKE price target in the first place is to tap into a ""wisdom of crowds"" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with NKE crossing above that average target price of $80.32/share, investors in NKE have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $80.32 just one stop on the way to an even higher target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table?",110.85045623779297

New Article What happened Shares of footwear giant Nike (NYSE: NKE) took a hit on Friday, falling about 6% as of 12:40 p.m. EDT. Shares are likely down following the report because of the company's weaker-than-expected North America sales growth and softer-than-anticipated guidance for its fiscal fourth-quarter revenue.

New Article As for individual stocks, Nike (NYSE: NKE) and Tiffany (NYSE: TIF) moved in opposite directions after reporting earnings. Stocks were pummeled Friday on worries of slowing global economic growth and an inversion of the yield curve , which is considered by some to presage a slowdown. Sales in the holiday period of November and December were reported earlier , so there were few surprises in today's announcement. New Article There, NKE grew sales double digits in spite of currency, geopolitical headwinds and central bank interference. The volume profile since the December lows suggests that the NKE stock value area spans all the way to $75 per share. This was the ledge from which NKE fell last 12% last October, so I imagine will be another battle zone for bulls and bears if the first support fails.

With shares up only slightly over the past year leading into these impressive results, it's hardly surprising to see Nike stock climbing as the market absorbs the news. New Article (+) Nike (NKE) climbed 4% after the athletic apparel company late Tuesday reported a fiscal Q1 profit of $0.86 per share, improving on net income of $0.67 during the same quarter last year and beating the Capital IQ consensus by $0.15 per share.

New Article As for individual stocks, Nike (NYSE: NKE) blew out expectations for its recent quarter, and controversy over vaping led to the end of merger talks between Altria Group (NYSE: MO) and Philip Morris International (NYSE: PM). Revenue grew 12% in constant currency in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa; 6% in Asia Pacific and Latin America; and 22% in Greater China, where digital sales soared a whopping 70%. Today, Altria CEO Howard Willard said in a press release, ""While we believed the creation of a new merged company had the potential to create incremental revenue and cost synergies, we could not reach agreement."" New Article When Nike (NYSE: NKE) released better-than-expected fiscal second-quarter 2020 results late Tuesday, shares of the footwear and sportswear company understandably rallied in response. For the quarter, this is reflected in the broad-based growth in all geographies, led by our international business, which grew 16%; double-digit growth in our women's business off the back of an incredible summer of celebrating female athletes; in both footwear and apparel, with our strong lineup of innovation and style, which continues to feed the growing consumer demand for comfortable athletic product; and in digital, which grew a very strong 42%, showing the power of more personal relationships with the consumer.

The company’s management has credited the addition as “accelerating our ability to better predict the right supply of products down to the style, color, and size… and enabling more accurate forward positioning of inventory in stores, online, and in DC’s.” Saad concludes, “Given Nike’s significant scale and IT spend advantage, coupled with its early lead in digital, we remain very bullish on the company’s ability to continue to maintain its momentum in digital (which remains just 13% of the business – up from 4% four years ago).” Following the analyst’s assessment, it is hardly surprising to learn Saad assigned an Outperform rating on Nike, alongside a price target of $150.

New Article The Overtime concept gives consumers access to apparel and footwear from major brands like Nike (NYSE: NKE), adidas, and Under Armour at prices of up to 75% off. Yet the largest sporting goods store doesn't have much of a competitive advantage other than its size, and even then the gear and accessories it sells can be found at larger rivals like Walmart or Amazon.com. Because their e-commerce operations are a secondary consideration to the treasure hunt atmosphere created by their physical stores, they were not able to respond as effectively as other retailers, including Dick's, that invested in omnichannel options. New Article Accordingly, even though Nike (NYSE:NKE) is likely to post ugly earnings this week, the release shouldn’t affect how investors view Nike stock. But Nike stock remains a hugely attractive long-term pick, even if this week’s earnings won’t necessarily show why.

New Article Nike (NYSE: NKE) stock fell Friday after the company reported worse fourth-quarter results than Wall Street expected. Under normal circumstances, its results are fairly predictable, but the coronavirus pandemic has removed any relevant comparison point, as no one really knows how retail establishments perform, or business in general, when there's a deadly virus spreading around the world.

New Article Store closures took a heavy toll on Nike's (NYSE: NKE) business last quarter, with sales dropping 38% year over year.

Despite headwinds that should continue through F1H21, we view NKE’s LT bull case remains intact: 1) Growth through direct channels is accelerating due to digital demand; 2) Greater China has already rebounded to positive growth and remains an attractive LT opportunity; 3) Innovative products and marketing are driving outperformance of women’s and kids, areas of strategic importance; and 4) data science is enabling better decision-making, benefiting sales and margins.” Accordingly, Patel reiterated a Buy on NKE along with a $113 price target.

New Article Nov 20 (Reuters) - Nike Inc NKE.N said on Friday it would raise its quarterly dividend by 12%, or 3 cents per share, underscoring the financial strength of the world's largest sportswear maker in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. The company's share price, up about 30% this year, has more than doubled since its March low as it slashed costs by cutting corporate jobs and targeted online investments. 2020 marks Nike's 19th consecutive year of increasing dividend payouts, after raising quarterly payments by 11% in 2019, and comes as many other companies either cut or pause shareholder returns due to the virus outbreak.

New Article I thought my three stocks to avoid for that week -- Opendoor Technologies (NASDAQ: OPEN), Nike (NYSE: NKE), and Carvana (NYSE: CVNA) -- were going to lose to the market. The egg producer was a beneficiary of prices skyrocketing during a supply shortage last year, but reality has come home to roost for Cal-Maine and its peers.
