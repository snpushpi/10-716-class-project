Even at a P/E of 60, which is expensive in this space compared to a competitor like McDonald's at a P/E of just 17, Chipotle's growth potential looks very strong going forward and five years from now current prices will probably look like a value. New Article Fast-food giants have grown increasingly desperate to innovate their menus with new concepts as traffic migrates to fast-casual chains like Chipotle Mexican Grill . While this data is nothing new, fast-food restaurants have grown increasingly creative with menu items in an attempt to find growth drivers, also catering menus to certain regions of the world based on food preferences.

New Article I was so impressed with the food and service that I dropped a brief note to the team praising its effort and asking a few questions about the privately owned company's business strategy. Chipotle has done a wonderful job in creating an exceptional work culture by adopting a decentralized approach, paying higher wages than the industry standard and offering opportunities for internal promotion to high performers. It has been investing everything back into the business to tap into the network effect -- a reinforcing mechanism in which as positive reviews from customers grow, the product and service look more attractive. New Article Chipotle (CMG) When I think of S&P 500 companies, I immediately think of smokestacks and manufacturing plants. But then I remember companies like Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG), the fast-casual concept that has taken America by storm.

They certainly do look more upscale than your local greasy spoon or burger joint, so as an incentive to have franchisees participate, Wendy's will reduce royalty payments from the restaurants for up to the three years after completing construction, which typically is the greater of 4% of gross sales or $1,000 per month, and is making available a third-party lender to help finance the changeover.

The survey found that millennials are more inclined than their parents' generation to go out of their way for a good meal, and are more concerned about the quality of the food they're eating. McDonald's is a restaurant for the industrial age, built on a frozen supply chain, and automated operations that include pre-heating food and keeping it warm in hot holding units before serving. New Article On their quarterly conference calls, Chipotle Mexican Grill executives regularly talk about ""opportunistically"" repurchasing stock ""to enhance shareholder value."" Yet while Chipotle has spent hundreds of millions of dollars in the last five years to buy back stock, these efforts haven't reduced its share count very much. Plenty of cash available Chipotle regularly tells analysts that its primary priority in terms of capital allocation is investing in growth.

With the menu changes and the company's recent store modernization, the chain is shifting toward the fast-casual segment and targeting millennial consumers that have flocked to Chipotle and other fresher-food options.

Taco Bell's morning takeover coming as as McDonald's was giving away its coffee to lure customers in and blunt the damage caused by the competition makes it even clearer: The burger joint is hurting.

With one of McDonald's most important segments under increasing attack from a rival fast-food chain, and the fast-casual restaurants seriously complicating the value of the company's broader offerings, simply introducing a more focused menu strategy is probably not a path to long-term success. McDonald's menu problems highlight a more serious issue facing the company: Its image is in the gutter, and the actions necessary to change this fact, at least in the short term, run counter to its corporate identity and business structure. New Article A simple menu, quality ingredients, and fast service are the pillars supporting Chipotle's success, and the company's ability to increase its prices without a negative effect on store traffic is a testament to its popularity among consumers. There are a lot of assumptions that have to be made in order to justify Chipotle's current stock price, and with little presence abroad, comparable-store sales expected to slow, and competition heating up, a P/E ratio near 50 for a chain of burrito restaurants seems excessive.

Restaurateurs are the ""centerpiece [that] leads to a better dining experience for our customers, better tasting food, faster throughput, the development of extraordinary future leaders, better business results, and ultimately the creation of significant shareholder value,"" executives say.",1276.462890625

New Article While Chipotle's fundamentals have only gotten worse over the past quarter, its forward P/E ratio has skyrocketed to a truly mind-boggling 268 -- the priciest CMG has been since it began trading publicly. For options trading expert Jared Levy, fast-casual restaurant chain Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE: CMG ) has long been one of his favorite ""go-to"" trades. Even After The Bloodletting, CMG Is Still Overvalued Instead of cutting costs and working to bring back customers, Chipotle is instead firing back with continued expansion, unsuccessful marketing videos and diversification into different kinds of food. New Article As for individual stocks, Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE: CMG) and Pacific Continental (NASDAQ: PCBK) stocks stood out with large price increases following market-moving news. Earnings are projected to be about $0.54 per share and fall below forecasts due to increased spending on promotions and advertising, in addition to higher food costs.

The radical improvement can be traced to the fact that November was the first month in which Chipotle began to comp against its crisis-plagued results from the previous year. Namely, it doesn't seem unreasonable to think that one of the reasons Chipotle's stock has suffered so much over the past year, after previously being heralded as a respected company with a very bright future, is because the burrito chain has had to repeatedly report double-digit same-store sales declines.

New Article After a year of posting horrendous sales declines, Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE: CMG) has finally pulled out of its dive. However, Chipotle's E. coli outbreak became a full-blown food safety crisis in November 2015, with comp sales declines bottoming out at 36.4% in January 2016.

New Article Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE: CMG) was one of the hottest restaurant chains in the business before the coronavirus pandemic hit. The burrito roller had been generating double-digit comparable sales growth, and had again won the acclaim of investors as the stock had more than tripled from a bottom in 2018 before new CEO Brian Niccol took the helm. Restaurant-level operating margin fell from 21% to 17.6%, which was impacted by increased delivery expense and higher labor costs, as the company has raised wages and paid additional bonuses during the crisis.

I think the only way that a lot of these businesses wind up becoming profitable long-term and really being successful is by squeezing the margins there and really, kind of, exerting their power, which is something that ultimately may be good for investors, but not so great for consumers and restaurants. As always, people on the program may own companies discussed on the show, and The Motley Fool may have formal recommendations for or against stocks mentioned, so don't buy or sell anything based solely on what you hear. New Article What happened Shares of Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE: CMG) were soaring today after the company delivered a first-quarter earnings report that calmed investors and convinced them that the burrito chain would not only survive the pandemic, but come out even stronger on the other side. Despite the beginning of lockdowns in March, which directly impacted the company, Chipotle still reported growth in revenue and comparable sales, and only a modest decline in earnings per share for the quarter, though that was helped by a tax benefit. Chipotle has no debt on its balance sheet and finished the quarter with $909 million in cash and short-term investments, putting it in a much better position than other restaurant stocks, and investors should be confident that the company can endure an extended impact from the crisis.

Now what Despite those positive trends, there's no question that Darden still has a long road ahead of it as the company has been forced to raise both debt and equity to manage through a challenging period, and dining rooms are unlikely to be full even after stay-at-home orders are lifted due to fears about the virus and the impact of a recession on consumer spending.",1110.3565673828125

Challenges remain, especially for the stock itself, as it currently trades for a whopping 97 times trailing 12-month free cash flow -- pricing it much more like a tech company than a restaurant. New Article Hill: Shares of Chipotle (NYSE: CMG) went down this week, despite a third quarter that most restaurants would kill for.

New Article Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE: CMG) is hungry for something shiny and new.
