It may not have made sense in earlier Surface Pro designs for Microsoft to go with a ""new"" LTE platform from Intel -- although options from other vendors such as Qualcomm were certainly viable.

New Article Additionally, Samsung recently made a relatively big deal about its category 9-capable Galaxy Note 4, which reportedly features a Samsung-designed cellular solution and an Exynos processor. However, if Samsung keeps the door open to Qualcomm -- which, per Strategy Analytics, owns over 50% of smartphone applications processor revenue share -- and allows it to eventually join the Galaxy S6 supply chain once the alleged issues with the Snapdragon 810 are worked out, then Qualcomm might be more comfortable transitioning more of its chip volumes to Samsung over time (Qualcomm has built cellular baseband processors at Samsung in the past, per Chipworks ; I'm not sure if it has ever built a Snapdragon processor).

It's also possible that any of the other major Android smartphone players could have gone with an NVIDIA Tegra processor or even a Texas Instruments OMPA in place of a high-end Snapdragon, but a few simple facts should point investors back at the Samsung explanation.

I would bet that for a product sampling in the second half of 2015 and likely set to be commercially deployed in early 2016, Qualcomm will use a FinFET manufacturing technology from either Taiwan Semiconductor or Samsung. New Article While that might make sense from a short-term profit-grabbing perspective, this viewpoint completely ignores the long-term implications of enabling competitors with better technology. These companies generate significant revenue and profit from selling applications processors, connectivity chips, and integrated solutions into the smartphone and tablet markets.

What I believe will be very interesting to watch is what applications processor and modem solution(s) Samsung uses for the Galaxy Note 5, which will presumably launch this fall. New Article ARM Holdings is the well-known processor intellectual property vendor whose designs power the vast majority of smartphones and tablets sold today. One reason that I'd want to be careful before modeling in these aggressive server projections for ARM is the simple fact that Intel has bested many powerful competitors in this market over the years.

If Intel can use Broxton to raise its average selling prices in tablets (meaning more revenue and ultimately gross profit dollars), that would still be a win. New Article Previously, Intel could not offer that, which hurt its competitiveness, particularly in the low end of the mobile market where device manufacturers are known to want to source all their platform components from a single vendor. Additionally, even in segments in which a complete bundled solution is not required, Intel can drive more revenue per platform by selling more chips into a particular mobile design. Intel has its act together in cellular, and continuing to execute on the rest of the connectivity chip suite would be a solid step forward for the company's mobile group.

New Article The majority of the leading-edge foundry business available today likely comes from Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM) and Apple, both of which build mobile chips that go into phones that compete with Samsung's. AppleInsider, citing a note to investors from KGI Securities' Ming-Chi Kuo, reported Wednesday that Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has made a ""last minute decision to recruit TSMC (NYSE: TSM)"" for the manufacture of the A9 processor said to be inside the upcoming iPhone. This reportedly means the South Korean electronics giant is allocating more 14-nanometer wafers for its own needs than originally expected, potentially at the expense of Apple's A9. New Article In our view, the company's recent partnerships with the likes of Qualcomm QCOM and Apple AAPL are significantly accretive for the company's overall growth.

New Article Samsung , one of its biggest customers, installed its own Exynos processor instead of Qualcomm's Snapdragon 810 in its flagship devices, causing the company to reduce its full-year sales guidance several times throughout the year . Investors lose, executives win In addition to a plunging stock price, Qualcomm fell behind the tech curve when Apple launched its first 64-bit mobile chip in 2013. But if Qualcomm is serious about challenging Intel in drones, wearables, and Internet of Things devices to expand beyond the saturated market for mobile chips, it should raise R&D expenses instead of buybacks. New Article Intel is trying to offset weak PC sales and hefty mobile subsidies by expanding its processors into new markets like drones, wearables, and connected devices. For Nvidia, diversification into drones isn't as urgent, since sales at its core GPU business rose 7% annually and accounted for 82% of its revenue in the first half of fiscal 2016. After failing to establish a firm foothold in smartphones, Nvidia promoted the Tegra as a potent chip for gaming tablets, 2-in-1 devices, and set-top boxes.

While that could certainly boost Qualcomm's top line again, Samsung's recent introduction of its own top-tier chipset, the Exynos 8 Octa 8890, strongly suggests otherwise. Instead, Qualcomm's future depends more on expanding its chips to new markets like drones and ensuring that Chinese OEMs stop underreporting shipments in order to pay lower licensing fees.

At the same time, the fact that Qualcomm shares are down so much, says Merrill, gives investors today an ""attractive entry point"" to buy the stock before that stabilization becomes apparent. Between the stock's 11.5% projected long-term growth rate, and its generous 3.9% dividend yield, Qualcomm shares are being valued at a total return ratio of precisely 1.0.

I'm not ready to say that this will be impossible to achieve, but I do think it will be quite difficult for Intel to close the technology gap with Qualcomm here given the latter's rapid pace of innovation. My guess is that Intel will announce the first details of its next-generation modems and other smartphone-related technologies at the Mobile World Congress event that will be held in February 2016. New Article Intel's purchase of Altera immediately cast a spotlight on Xilinx , the only other major maker of FPGAs, as a potential partner or takeover target for rival chipmakers. To find out, let's compare Xilinx's business to Altera's, discuss its fundamental growth, and understand the impact of its deals with Qualcomm and IBM. Both Qualcomm and IBM have ambitious goals, but it will be hard for either company to loosen Intel's grip on the data center market. New Article Leading wireless technology developer Qualcomm (Nasdaq:QCOM) is facing anti-trust charges by the FTC (Fair Trade Commission) of South Korea, which regarded its licensing practices as anti-competitive and violating the Korean law. These areas include automotive communications, the Internet-of-Things (IoT), mobile computing, networking, small cell commenucations and data center solutions. However, the company needs to expand its R&D and patent portfolio in these areas at a faster rate to offset the decline in its licensing revenues due to litigation charges globally. New Article But Erickson believes GoPro inventory is swelling at retailers, which wouldn't bode well for Ambarella either since that would effectively translate into its chips sitting on shelves collecting dust as well. High performance action cameras haven't gained enough adoption as a product category to the point where they are a popular holiday gift, such as TVs or other types of gadgets. By consolidating these functions, Qualcomm can offer manufacturers cost savings and design efficiencies, which can potentially bring down prices and subsequently boost consumer demand. New Article FPGAs are less powerful than IBM's or Intel's server chips, but they can be reprogrammed, making them well-suited for custom uses in connected cars, consumer devices, and airplanes. By combining Saffron with its own server chips and Altera's FPGAs, Intel can offer companies an all-in-one data center solution which cuts Big Blue out of the loop.

Scaling back mobile chip investment, but pressing on in cellular connectivity Take a look at the following slide from Intel CFO Stacy Smith's presentation at the company's November 2015 analyst day: Notice that there is indeed a big cutback in combined research and development as well as marketing spending related to smartphones and tablets. The comparable Qualcomm modem -- the Snapdragon X12 -- appears to be superior to the XMM 7360 in a number of ways (greater peak upload/download speeds, built on a newer manufacturing node, and so on), which is a key reason that I'm skeptical Intel has actually won this design. New Article As I noted in my write-up on this news, there's plenty of reason to be skeptical of this, particularly as Qualcomm 's modem technology -- which Apple has traditionally used exclusively for its iPhones -- is miles ahead of what Intel currently offers. Stacy Rasgon, an analyst with Bernstein Research, recently put out another reason to be skeptical of such a win: Qualcomm's optimism around the operating margin of its chip business. Just like newspaper publishers, telephone utilities, stockbrokers, record companies, bookstores, travel agencies, and big box retailers did when the Internet swept away their business models. New Article A faster-than-expected decline in chipmaking revenues would also force Qualcomm to accelerate its expansion into non-mobile markets like connected cars, action cameras, drones, and data centers. Through those agreements, Intel gave OEMs steep discounts on Atom chips, provided financial assistance in redesigning logic boards, and financed co-marketing deals. Even if Apple pays full price for Intel modems, a 1% to 2% bump in earnings won't likely offset the chipmaker's ongoing declines in PC sales and slowing demand for data center chips.

New Article InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Arbitrageurs, who buy a stock to profit from a takeover, are big losers today after the U.S. government ended the drama between Broadcom Ltd (NASDAQ: AVGO ) and Qualcomm, Inc. (NASDAQ: QCOM ) by giving their deal a firm ""no."" The cancellation has deep ramifications for the entire tech sector, especially since the Administration's reason for it was fear of China taking vital U.S. technology from a Singapore company. Their reasoning was that Tan has a reputation for running his companies as a ""roll-up,"" buying a monopoly position in key technologies, cutting research and raising prices. New Article For those of us not obsessed with porn stars and Russia investigations, the big news yesterday was the intervention by the White House to block the proposed takeover of Qualcomm (QCOM) by Broadcom (AVGO). Even after you factor in the inevitable synergies of such a deal, Broadcom obviously saw value in QCOM at or above the current price. The beauty of buying QCOM at a discount as the deal collapses, however, is that you do not need a complete win on the Apple dispute or a massively successful deal with NXP to make the trade make sense. New Article While the analysts didn’t mention potential suitors, recent M&A speculation centers on the likes of Broadcom (AVGO), which is currently pursuing Qualcomm (QCOM). ""We see DRAM pricing resuming an upward trend in Q2, a first-time dividend and share buyback announcement in May, continued margin expansion in NAND and increased M&A discussion as important catalysts,"" Shah noted. But citing supplier plans, Shah expects an increase in the quarters ahead, saying that even a 500-basis point rise in DRAM pricing has the potential to boost Micron’s annual revenue by $1 billion, while having a 70-cent positive effect on EPS.

New Article Back in November I discussed the rationale behind Broadcom’s (AVGO) M&A pursuit of Qualcomm (QCOM), which, according to prominent market observers who followed this drama, the courting process between the two companies became a hostile takeover attempt. When Singapore-based Broadcom reports first quarter fiscal 2018 earnings results after the closing bell Thursday, CEO Hock Tan is going to be pressed for details and any insights about his next move beyond San Diego-based Qualcomm. There was ""credible evidence"" to suggest that Broadcom ""through exercising control of Qualcomm Incorporated, a Delaware corporation, might take action that threatens to impair the national security of the United States,” Trump said in his presidential order. New Article Stocks to Sell: Qualcomm (QCOM) Qualcomm, Inc. (NASDAQ: QCOM ) shares have been in the news after the Trump Administration axed a potential acquisition by Broadcom Ltd (NASDAQ: AVGO ) citing national security concerns.

(NASDAQ: QCOM ) blocked and a pending return to the U.S., AVGO is left wondering where to go next. In a recent article about Qualcomm, I described QCOM as falling into a lose-lose situation with the merger. Moreover, as the company plans its next product releases and acquisition targets, investors should decide if the failed merger presents them with a buying opportunity in Broadcom stock. New Article Chipmaker Broadcom Ltd (NASDAQ: AVGO ) was due to acquire Qualcomm, Inc. (NASDAQ: QCOM ), but the Trump administration blocked the deal. Many are wondering if QCOM will turn its sights on Micron in the wake of the failed deal, which is a definite possibility. So far, MU has been enjoying high-demand for its products giving the firm a lot of pricing power but many believe that a lull is on the horizon and with it, a pullback for Micron stock. New Article I'm relatively skeptical on that front, though I suppose Broadcom Ltd (NASDAQ: AVGO ) could be considered a suitor now that its acquisition of Qualcomm, Inc. (NASDAQ: QCOM ) has fallen through. And while the vulnerabilities are referred to as ""second stage"" - meaning hackers would have to gain administrative privileges before exploiting the flaws - they could, in theory, present significant risks for cloud providers like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT ) and major enterprise customers. The argument from Viceroy is that Ryzen and EPYC are so important to AMD - which needed to catch up to Intel and Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA ), among others - that the products were rushed to market. New Article A 2012 congressional report said that Huawei could use its 5G tech to spy on Americans, and most recently, President Trump signed an executive order to stop the hostile takeover bid that Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) was making for Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM) based on national security concerns. China has taken notice of NVIDIA's AI chip dominance, and has specifically named the company several times over the past few years as one it wants its homegrown players to challenge. The government earlier had expressed concern that if Broadcom bought Qualcomm, the merged company could cut back on its investments in wireless tech, which might result in the U.S. failing to set the standards for future 5G technology.

(QCOM) said that it strongly disagreed with the ruling of U.S. District Court in favor of the Federal Trade Commission's suit alleging the mobile chips maker illegally suppressed competition. In Wednesday pre-market trade, QCOM is trading at $69.60, down $8.15 or 10.48 percent. U.S. District Court Judge Lucy Koh ruled that Qualcomm unlawfully suppressed competition in the market for cellphone chips and used its dominant position to impose excessive licensing fees. New Article (-) US District Judge Lucy Koh for the Northern District of California has ruled that Qualcomm (QCOM) violated antitrust law by charging unreasonably high royalties for its patents, media including Reuters reported. Stocks moving on news include: (-) Pure Storage (PSTG), which was declining more than 17% after the data solutions provider reported fiscal Q1 results that missed Wall Street expectations. Analysts polled by Capital IQ expected the company to record a GAAP loss of $0.76 per share in the quarter. New Article Trump’s FTC has a majority of Republican appointees, but didn’t stop the process, even though the president’s decision to sink Broadcom’s hostile $117 billion bid last year effectively crowned Qualcomm as a national champion. Meanwhile, the DOJ tried and failed to persuade U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh to hold a hearing, arguing harsh remedies could harm competition. Antitrust boss Makan Delrahim has the final decision at Justice and has another issue to factor in: the duo’s claim they will build better 5G infrastructure together is one of Trump’s favorite initiatives. New Article As for individual stocks, investors had thought that it would be smooth sailing for Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM) after it settled its fight with Apple last month, but a new court ruling put a cloud over the chipmaker once again. The ruling also specifies that Qualcomm can't enter into any exclusive supply agreements for the chips, explicitly calling out the deal the company made with Apple. The same-day fulfillment options of in-store pickup, Drive-Up, and Shipt drove over a quarter of the company's total comp growth in the period, showing that worries about the threat of Amazon's expanding one-day service may be overblown. New Article (-) Qualcomm (QCOM) fell 11% after the chipmaker said it ""strongly disagrees"" with a US District Court ruling in California late Tuesday siding with the US Federal Trade Commission's contention that Qualcomm's licensing practices make it nearly impossible for rivals also producing modem chips to compete. Among technology stocks moving on news: (-) Analog Devices (ADI) rose 2%, reversing an earlier decline, after the electronics manufacturer issued a disappointing Q3 profit and sales forecast, blaming the likely shortfall on recent US restrictions on export transactions with Chinese networking giant Huawei. (-) Pure Storage (PSTG) dropped 25% after the data storage company missed Wall Street expectations with its most recent financial results, posting a non-GAAP net loss of $0.11 per share on $326.7 million in revenue for its Q1 ended April 30 compared with the Capital IQ consensus looking for an $0.08 per share adjusted loss on $333.1 million in revenue. New Article Qualcomm (QCOM) Chip giant Qualcomm (NASDAQ:) has had some struggles recently. QCOM stock is quite cheap at current levels. Historically speaking, QCOM stock trades at a much bigger multiple with a much lower yield. New Article What happened Shares of semiconductor giant Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM) plunged sharply on Wednesday, trading 12.1% lower at 1 p.m. EDT. Earlier this year, analyst firm Kerrisdale Capital argued that Qualcomm might lose half of its market value if that trial closed with the wrong conclusion. The company must now renegotiate many licensing contracts, removing onerous deal terms in order to reach a more competitive market for communications chips. New Article A federal judge sided with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and ruled that Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM) used anticompetitive practices to unlawfully stifle competition related to wireless modem technology used in smartphones. U.S. District Court Judge Lucy Koh handed down a comprehensive 230-page decision, laying out a list of practices that Qualcomm used to force mobile phone makers to pay excessive fees for use of its patents, many of which are considered ""industry-essential,"" and are therefore required to be licensed at fair and reasonable terms. The judge said that the testimony of Qualcomm CEO Steve Mollenkopf and President Cristiano R. Amon was directly contradicted by company emails and communications from the two, and therefore lacked credibility. New Article It's been a few months since the Federal Trade Commission's antitrust lawsuit against Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM) wrapped up at the end of January, and federal Judge Lucy Koh has now ruled against the mobile chip giant in a scathing 233-page decision that lambasts Qualcomm for a wide range of anticompetitive business practices. This agreement undermined competition in the market, while allowing Qualcomm to charge elevated royalty rates for its intellectual property (IP). Koh doesn't pull any punches when describing the net result: ""In combination, Qualcomm's licensing practices have strangled competition in the CDMA and premium LTE modem chip markets for years, and harmed rivals, OEMs, and end consumers in the process.""",116.5550537109375

New Article In the meantime, Nokia has fallen into the same quagmire as Qualcomm (NASDAQ:), facing lawsuits that claim the company — in violation of U.S. antitrust law — conspired with other patent holders to improperly inflate the price of some of its wireless connectivity technologies used in automobiles.

The company expects to recognize $1.8 billion of revenue in the fiscal fourth quarter related to the agreement, which covers Huawei's sales since the start of 2020. Qualcomm's guidance assumes a 15% decline in handset shipments due to COVID-19, along with a delay of an unnamed global 5G flagship phone, presumed to be Apple's upcoming 5G iPhones. New Article Earlier in the day, official data showed the U.S. economy suffered its steepest contraction since the Great Depression in the second quarter, as business activity came to an abrupt halt on efforts to slow the virus outbreak. Jobless claims also rose in the latest week, adding to signs the momentum of economic recovery has slowed as coronavirus cases spiraled in southern and western U.S. states. The U.S. Federal Reserve on Wednesday acknowledged the surge in cases was likely stalling recovery, while pledging to support the economy as long as necessary, giving a boost to Wall Street's three main indexes late in the session.",129.652587890625

But the whole reason to look at the average QCOM price target in the first place is to tap into a ""wisdom of crowds"" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with QCOM crossing above that average target price of $108.28/share, investors in QCOM have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $108.28 just one stop on the way to an even higher target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table?

New Article Qualcomm (QCOM) is one such company. “Overall,” the 5-star analyst summed up, “QCOM remains well positioned to see further revenue acceleration in FY21E driven by the ramp of 5G devices and corresponding content gains (modem+RFFE), y/y growth in QTL (DBe FY21 QTL revs +12% y/y) as all major handset OEMs are now paying royalties, with operating leverage improving on higher volumes/cost controls.

New Article Apple announced in June that it was beginning a two-year initiative to shift to internally designed chips, and the new M1-powered Mac computers could mark a transition that sends shockwaves through the semiconductor industry. Apple's aggressive shift to proprietary chips for its Mac computers presents another challenge for Intel at a time when the semiconductor giant is facing setbacks on multiple fronts. Intel's seven-nanometer (7nm) chips were delayed to 2022, and Apple's jump to internally designed ARM processors could also help pave the way for a mobile-processing leader like Qualcomm to gain ground in PCs and laptops.

New Article But a second-half comeback may not be in the game plan over at leading mobile chip designer Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM). Specifically, CEO Cristiano Amon had this to say on the earnings call: The evolving macroeconomic backdrop has resulted in further demand deterioration, particularly in handsets, at a magnitude greater than we previously forecasted. Additionally, while expectations are for a rebound in China demand in the second half of the calendar year, we have not seen evidence of meaningful recovery and are not incorporating improvements into our planning assumptions.

New Article TSMC (NYSE: TSM) and Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM) represent two very different ways to invest in the growing semiconductor market. That deceleration was caused by slower sales of PCs in a post-pandemic market, the end of the initial 5G upgrade cycle in smartphones, and macroeconomic headwinds for enterprise-oriented chips.

New Article Apple also faces a risk from a weak smartphone market in China, one of its biggest markets, especially after Qualcomm's (QCOM) tepid revenue forecast Wednesday underlined weak demand for mobile devices. However, with both stocks trading at elevated multiples and facing headwinds to their core businesses, there will be pressure for today’s earnings results to justify their recent sharp rallies. Bloomberg Intelligence notes that the fiscal third quarter is a seasonally weak period for Apple, with the Mac being the sole product category that may post better-than-expected results. New Article Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if QCOM shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Qualcomm Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing QCOM's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $121.00 strike highlighted in red: Considering the fact that the $121.00 strike represents an approximate 5% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.

This morning’s positive comments from Richmond Fed President Barkin were also bullish for stocks when he said the larger-than-expected easing in inflation in June might be an indication the U.S. economy can have a ""soft landing,"" returning to price stability without a damaging recession.

New Article What happened Shares of semiconductor maker Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM) tumbled 9.9% through 11:55 a.m. Analysts had forecast that Qualcomm would do $8.5 billion in sales for its fiscal Q3 2023, but the company fell about $60 million short of that mark. Granted, at less than 16 times expected 2023 (non-GAAP) earnings, and paying a 2.4% dividend yield, there's an argument to be made that Qualcomm stock is cheap, and should be bought on today's weakness.
