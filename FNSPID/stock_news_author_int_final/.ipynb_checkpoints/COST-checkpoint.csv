First, Citigroup announced through a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it was lowering its unreserved legal costs through September from $5 billion to $4 billion.

New Article For now, everyone seems focused on the company's change in how Costco manages its credit card business, having made the switch from a formerly exclusive deal with American Express and instead going with banking rival Citigroup . In order for Costco stock to keep climbing, though, it will have to go beyond special dividend payments and new credit arrangements to keep delivering membership growth and greater sales from its existing customer base. As a result, it's reasonable to conclude that Costco should see some financial benefits from the partnership, and the greater prevalence of Visa -backed cards could help Costco boost its business somewhat as well.

Cost containment in procuring merchandise remained an important part of Costco's profitability, but a 4% jump in overhead expenses was large enough to pull operating income downward slightly compared to last year's fiscal first quarter.

New Article A recent study by BMO Capital Markets found that when it comes to the best prices and speediest shipping, Costco actually beats Amazon. The Amazon effect could, however, ""continue to create an overhang on COST shares and limit valuation upside,"" BMO's Kelly Bania wrote in a report last month. Costco ( COST ) topped fiscal fourth-quarter estimates on the top line, bottom line and key same-store sales metrics late Thursday, but one metric still fell short. New Article A host of other retailers, including Costco ( COST ) and Target ( TGT ), responded with their own wage hikes in the spring of 2016. Amazon [ibd-display-video id=2326939 width=50 float=left autostart=true] The August employment report showed that non-store retailers added just 700 jobs on a seasonally adjusted basis, the weakest month of hiring by the group since September 2016. Amazon's one-day hiring binge didn't show up because the Labor Department conducted its survey of employers in the week starting Sunday, Aug. 6. New Article While Costco has suffered from a few headwinds in 2017, the lion's share of the blame goes to Amazon.com's ( AMZN ) $13.4 billion buyout of organic grocer Whole Foods ( WFM ), announced in mid-June. The fear sparking the selling is that Amazon - using Whole Foods' physical locations as a distribution network - will better be able to build out its AmazonFresh grocery delivery service, further cutting into sales at brick-and-mortar operations such as Costco's. In fact, Wall Street's expectations for Costco's fiscal fourth quarter - roughly 14% growth in both earnings (to $2.01 per share) and revenues ($41.6 billion) - should have most retailers chartreuse with envy. New Article The shares have risen more than 10% since falling to a recent low of $150.06 in August amid increasing pessimism that Amazon’s blockbuster deal for Whole Foods would threaten Costco’s business. Investors have come to realize that, despite operating in a highly competitive and mature retail industry, Costco’s strong fundamentals continue to attract bullish targets from analysts. And given that it makes the bulk of its revenue on membership fees, as opposed to retail volume, Costco is well insulated from the issues that affect other brick-and-mortar peers such as Target (TGT), Kroger (KR), among others.",372.18994140625

It's fair to say that worries over a growth slowdown at Costco (NASDAQ: COST) were overblown. And -- except for a stubbornly flat membership renewal rate -- just about all of Costco's key business metrics improved. New Article In 2016, Wal-Mart's ( WMT ) total revenue during the fiscal fourth quarter remained about flat at $130 billion, while the overall retail sector grew 3% year-over-year (y-o-y) during the holiday period. Wal-Mart still relies heavily on in-store sales, which could be negatively impacted by the ongoing customer shift from store to online shopping.

New Article Simply put, Katai calls Costco ""one of the most consistent operators in our group,"" featuring ""steady traffic gains and high membership renewal rates"" that make it a standout in a retail sector where worries about consumer spending in a recession abound. Indeed, according to Katai, consumers appear to be switching away from other retailers and increasingly patronizing warehouse stores -- and Costco in particular -- as a way to save money in a high inflation environment. As a result, Costco investors can count on ""consistently strong traffic trends"" buoying their stock going forward, and providing all the cash Costco needs to keep buying back stock, paying its modest 0.7% regular dividend, and potentially even paying out an even bigger one-time ""special"" dividend if things go really well for the business -- an event Katai describes as ""likely.""",388.57421875

This would put whole shares out of the reach of small investors and make Costco ineligible for an addition to the Dow 30, a price-weighted index. At that point, the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio was nearing 50, and again, Costco did not need low share prices to reach such a multiple.

For the period, which ended Oct. 29, selling, general, and administrative costs also rose faster than sales due in part to higher wages and increased costs for benefits. It has also leveraged its stores to support its e-commerce business in a cost-effective way, and its owned brand portfolio has grown to more than $30 billion in annual revenue. New Article But Costco isn't exactly immune to the economic situation as the latest monthly financial results showed a sizable slowdown from the double-digit gains the business registered over the past couple of years. If inflation peaks, interest rates level off, and the economy starts doing well next year, then Costco should thrive, given that the individual consumer should be in solid financial shape and willing to spend. With $1,000 ready to put to work, investors should seriously consider buying shares of Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ: COST) in 2023.
