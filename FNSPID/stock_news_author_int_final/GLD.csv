New Article DC: Yes, the SPDR Gold Trust ( ETF ) ( GLD ) and other ETFs are now holding well over half of the worldwide production in vaults, a source of demand that is a newcomer to the gold party. Now, in terms of production companies with profitable operations, such relationships make perfect sense because market participants primarily evaluate them on their ability to generate cash flows and less so on their intrinsic or net asset value. As I mentioned before, although we evaluate exploration companies based on their growth of resource potential, we are always highly cognizant of infrastructure and other crucial impediments to developing a mine that could render such an economic deposit worthless because of factors that have nothing to do with what's in the ground. New Article A: The benefit of buying gold (or a gold ETF like the SPDR Gold Shares ( GLD ) ) is that you aren't paying for the operating expenses of gold companies and you are eliminating company-specific risk. The yellow metal is spiking to a new all time (non inflation-adjusted) highs of nearly $1,300 per ounce on renewed speculation that the Federal Reserve's next moves will only strengthen the case for higher gold prices down the road. That's because budget deficits are now far higher, and if the United States can't meet its obligations, then inflation will rise as the Fed raises interest rates to keep attracting buyers for its debt. New Article In the end, it appears that nothing beats gold for protection from Uncle Sam's printing press, however, and [[GLD]] (SPDR Gold Trust ETF) is vehicle of choice this year.

The Fed's qualitative and quantitative easing moves have, to this point, clearly succeeded in keeping the major banks afloat on life support, removing the most problematic of their assets from their balance sheets and stuffing them full of liquidity in order to offset continued losses from the remainder of their portfolios. That would land us back at square one, reversing the Fed's attempts to rescue the big banks and put the financial system on life support, and I don't see Bernanke waking up to reality anytime soon and pulling a complete 180.",144.0299072265625

IU.com:Is the relevance of GLD compromised in a market for gold that's no longer bullish? New Article Let's analyze the upcoming events that may affect gold ( GLD ) and silver ( SLV ). On the other hand, the Fed is having little help from the government: The IMF recently criticized U.S policy makers for the budget cuts. Last month, the FOMC left it policy unchanged, and in his recent testimony in Congress, Bernanke didn't offer any insight regarding when the Fed will start tapering QE3.

The precious metal was pressured ahead of the start of the two day Federal Open Market Committee meeting on Tuesday, with the Fed's decision to be announced 2 pm E.T. New Article It seems as though the micro alternative count in the metals is playing out, where the bottom to the a-wave of wave v of 3 completed this past week in the Mini Silver Futures Contract, whereas the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSEARCA:GLD) still has an impulsive structure to the downside, which would make this rise a c-wave in a wave 2 retrace. But, in all cases, as long as silver remains below 23.05 and GLD below 137.62, I am still expecting lower levels to be seen in both. The target region for GLD is in the 124.75-127 region, and silver will likely see a 19/20 handle, with a strong support region in the 19.60 region.

The SPDR Gold Shares ( GLD ) is the largest physically backed exchange-traded fund and the fund has seen sharp outflows as gold prices skidded. Gold prices are down about 36% from the all-time nominal high from September 2011 and 29% from the high in December 2012, when the GLD had record holdings.

Stocks are set to extend yesterday's gains and precious metals crashed, but a much-worse-than-expected GDP report could throw the markets off.

New Article Gold (NYSE:GLD) and Silver (NYSE:SLV) prices continued to see volatile movements as geo-political tension resulted in investors seeking defensive assets. While market anxiety has eased due to lack of international coalition for US in a potential military action in Syria and after President Obama opted to seek congressional authorization, investor's fears still linger since Obama looks adamant on taking punitive action. Most important data would be the August jobs report, which might prove decisive in determining whether the Federal Reserve will dial back its bond purchases in mid-September. New Article Back in June I predicted that the SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) was getting oversold due in large part because of the tremendous pessimism surrounding its downward spiral. Since that time, GLD has rallied nearly 20% from its low. GLD as now regained several key technical levels and is in a strong up-trend, which has been due in large part to a weaker US dollar and strong foreign demand. New Article In looking at the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSEARCA:GLD), I am leaning to this being just the a-wave of iv, since it would seem that GLD would need to come down lower than it already has. In fact, ideally, I really wanted to see GLD come down to the 131/132 region for this wave iv, so it still has a big lower to reach before I would think that the wave iv has completed. First, when I look at GLD, I see the negative divergence in this second move up relative to the first move up off the lows.",143.3229522705078

Monday, September 9, 2013 Positive economic growth data out of China and Japan provide a favorable backdrop for today's trading action as Congress returns to discuss the Syria issue. That said, China's growth outlook appears a lot more reassuring than many of the other major emerging market economies that have to deal with a less helpful post-QE international financial backdrop. New Article Oil and Gold (NYSE:GLD) prices edged higher as uncertainty on Syria kept markets nervous. US bond yields also rallied above 3% before ending the week at 2.93% as jobs data due on Friday was weaker than expected and eased worries for a September taper. President Obama's efforts to convince reluctant lawmakers and congressmen to back his request for a military strike could lead to significant volatility in the markets this week. New Article Once we top and begin the confirmed decline, I will then explore the potential that we have a 5-wave structure in silver off the lows, but it is almost impossible to come to the same conclusion in GLD. Last weekend, I left you with the following preferred perspective (per Elliott Wave Theory) for the metals: In looking at the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSEARCA:GLD), I am leaning to this being just the a-wave of iv, since it would seem that GLD would need to come down lower than it already has.

This year has not been good to investors in oil exploration and production companies generally, but Anadarko has wrestled with company-specific problems, ranging from four straight quarters of larger-than-expected losses to a tragic home explosion in Colorado that was traced to a leak from an Anadarko-owned gas pipeline. The buybacks are a reversal from just a year ago, when the company issued almost $2 billion of new stock for the purpose of acquiring assets in the Gulf of Mexico, and the market appears to approve of a move in the direction of more financial discipline. New Article Wednesday's price action was fueled by a hawkish Fed monetary policy statement which drove the market to a three week low. Federal Reserve comments drove up U.S. Treasury yields, making the U.S. Dollar a more attractive investment while curbing demand for the precious metal. Forecast The Fed's announcement on another interest rate hike this year took the markets by surprise as a series of poor inflation readings had dampened expectations for such a step. New Article Originally published on ETFtrends.com > When it comes to gold ETFs, such as the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSEArca: GLD ) , several countries are believed to have wide-ranging impact on the yellow metal. Tom Lydon's clients own shares of GLD. Moreover, in the face of a stronger dollar and speculation that the Federal Reserve could raise interest rates over the mid- and long-term, gold prices could still move modestly higher with some help from increased demand out of the emerging markets, namely China and India . New Article December Comex Gold is trading lower shortly before the regular session opening. The selling is continuing after Wednesday's sell-off was triggered by a surprisingly hawkish U.S. Federal Reserve monetary policy statement. This puts the market in a position to post a potentially bullish closing price reversal bottom. New Article On the daily chart, the XAUUSD pair moved below a major support trend line from 1204.77 to 1275.64, indicating that the upside movement from 1204.77 had completed at 1357.45 already. As long as the gold price is below the falling trend line on the 4-hour chart, the downside movement from 1357.45 could be expected to continue and further decline to test 1275.64 key support is possible. A breakdown below this level would confirm that the uptrend from the December 2016 low of 1122.56 is complete, then the following bearish movement could take price back towards the bullish trend line from 1046.27 to 1122.56 on the weekly chart, now at 1177. New Article In the meantime, I would expect pullbacks to be buying opportunities, as the $1300 level was the scene of a massive breakout, and in theory, should be supportive going forward. Ultimately, I do think the gold goes higher, because the ""new normal"" in interest rates for the Federal Reserve is probably going to be closer to 2% instead of the previous 5% we have been used to seeing out of the United States.

Despite U.S. secretary of state Mike Pompeo laying a  browbeat-on  Iran, a military escalation is unlikely and given the market’s tendency to quickly sidestep lone wolf or small group terrorist attacks, oil prices have come off the boil as traders pivot back to the task at hand.

Investors are looking forward to Friday’s U.S. non-farm payrolls report, which could create a highly volatile session, but gold could bounce back due to continued weak indicators and steady central bank buying. Investors are closely monitoring the impact of the Fed’s monetary policy tightening on the economy, with last week’s jobless claims figures and the nonfarm payrolls report providing more clues. New Article A little bit of a pullback could offer value, especially if we drop down towards the $2000 level, which is an area that is a large, round, psychologically significant figure. As traders worry about losing wealth, gold provides a safe haven asset and that’s the exact trade that we have seen for so long. Furthermore, some traders are starting to buy gold due to the fact that they believe the Federal Reserve is going to have to go back into quantitative easing.",123.4796142578125

April 11 (Reuters) - Gold prices rose on Tuesday after falling more than 1% in the previous session, as the dollar eased while investors awaited this week's U.S. inflation data that could influence the Federal Reserve's monetary policy trajectory. USD/ * Investors are now awaiting the U.S. consumer price data due on Wednesday for more clarity on the path of rates heading into the Fed's May policy meeting. New Article On Thursday, the SPDR Gold Shares ETF (GLD) settled at $186.46, down $1.37 or -0.73%. This development raised expectations of another rate hike by the Federal Reserve in May, leading to profit-taking and weaker gold prices. However, a higher core U.S. CPI report on Wednesday could solidify a 25 bps hike and make it less likely for gold prices to reach all-time highs this month unless there is a new catalyst. New Article It’ll be interesting to see how this plays out, but you can see that we have had a massive impulsive move to the upside a couple of weeks ago, and now we have seen a lot of choppiness in more of a grinding channel. I think it more or less speaks to the lack of momentum at this point, and those who got into gold a few weeks ago are more willing in an environment like this to take profits off a move that has been almost $200.

Most other gold-focused ETFs saw much less in terms of flows, but IAU’s spike interestingly takes it into positive territory for YTD flows overall, though it has some way to go to catch up to GLD’s $1.08 billion in that time. Gold ETF flows may be responding to global turmoil that has also seen central banks worldwide buy significant amounts of the precious metal, as a downturn in markets may be anticipated. New Article Price subsequently bounced and triggered a bullish reversal today as gold rallied to a four-day high before turning back down intraday.

Despite this, the news of China’s economic recovery gathered pace in the first quarter, with the country’s gross domestic product growing 4.5% year-on-year, beating expectations. Overall, the rise in gold prices on Tuesday was driven by a combination of factors, including the easing of the U.S. dollar and the news of China’s economic recovery.

The US dollar of course has a negative correlation to thegold market but at the end of the day if wealth preservation is the sole reason gold continues to rally, then I think you also have to keep an eye on other risk assets, to make sure that that’s exactly what’s going on. New Article On Wednesday, the SPDR Gold Shares ETF (GLD) settled at $185.36, down $0.89 or -0.48%. FXEmpire.com - Highlights Gold rises as investors brace for more rate hikes to combat inflation Wave of hawkish remarks from global central banks Market pricing in 83.7% chance of 25 basis-point Fed hike in May Overview Gold (XAU) is inching higher on Thursday, mirroring the steady price action in U.S. Treasury bonds and the U.S. Dollar. After hitting a more than two-week low in the previous session, investors are now grappling with the likelihood of more interest rate hikes by the global central banks to contain inflationary pressures. New Article Looking today at week-over-week shares outstanding changes among the universe of ETFs covered at ETF Channel, one standout is the SPDR Gold Shares (Symbol: GLD) where we have detected an approximate $556.1 million dollar outflow -- that's a 0.9% decrease week over week (from 322,700,000 to 319,700,000). The chart below shows the one year price performance of GLD, versus its 200 day moving average: Looking at the chart above, GLD's low point in its 52 week range is $150.5703 per share, with $190.41 as the 52 week high point — that compares with a last trade of $186.40.

We can’t see when that price may be hit, but it is clear from the chart that unless there is a sharp spike higher in the next day or two, gold will be reaching that target while remaining within the borders of the flag.

If we were to somehow take off to the upside and move past the $2100 level, gold could really start to take off at that point, and it could be more of a “buy-and-hold” type of situation.

New Article I do think that gold pulling back a bit here makes a certain amount of sense, because when you look at the longer-term charts you can see that this is an area that’s been important multiple times. At the very least, you need to see the market consolidate for a while and work off some of the excess froth after a straight shot in the air from the lows.

FXEmpire.com - Highlights Gold prices flat with yields down, dollar up Central bank meetings to provide clarity on rate-hike strategies Market prices in a hike by US Federal Reserve in May Overview Gold (XAU) is flat on Monday with losses limited by a dip in U.S. Treasury yields and gains capped by a firm U.S. Dollar. The downward pressure on gold prices is being further compounded by some firming in U.S. Treasury yields, following the release of last Friday’s flash PMI data. New Article It’s worth noting that the $2100 level above is an area where we’ve seen a lot of resistance previously, so if we were to somehow take off and break above there, gold markets will become more “buy-and-hold” than they are at the moment. In the short-term, I anticipate seeing a lot of back-and-forth choppy behavior, but I prefer to buy dips as it goes with the longer-term trend, and I’m not trying to get too cute by shorting the market every time it rallies.

New Article The rally triggered a bull trend continuation and an initial breakout of a 12-year base that takes the form of a cup with handle.

New Article The SPDR Gold Shares ETF (GLD) is at $187.42, down $3.02 or -1.59%. While the data may not lead to a rate hike by the Fed in June, it may remind rate-cut supporters to settle down, which is putting pressure on zero-yield gold. So, in times of high uncertainty around the US banking sector and debt ceiling, it’s important to hold on to your hats as price action could get nasty and punish both bulls and bears. New Article With the SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) -- the largest gold-backed exchange traded fund by assets -- higher by 12.26% year-to-date, it’s easy for investors to renew their affinity for the yellow metal. On the other hand, it’s advisable to not become overly enthralled by barely more than four months of performance and rather focus on how gold and ETFs such as GLD can benefit long-term portfolios. Gold or a fund such as GLD or the SPDR Gold MiniShares (GLDM) can act as a diversification tool. New Article FXEmpire.com - I penned an article in late September proclaiming a potential bottom in gold as interest rates peaked. Contrary Indicator A key factor bolstering my belief that gold was nearing a major bottom last year was the proclamation on the front page of the Wall Street Journal’s business and finance section, stating, “Gold Loses Status as Haven.” This headline printed on September 20, 2022, and was a beautifully timed contrarian indicator!

New Article Traders have been using gold as a safe haven asset and market to protect wealth over the last couple of months, and it reached a bit of the crescendo this past week. As we tried to reach for a fresh, new high, the market turned around and got slammed on Friday by the Non-Farm Payroll numbers coming in hotter than anticipated. Whether or not it can hold remains to be seen but it is probably worth noting that the banking crisis in the United States has not gone anywhere, so it does make a certain amount of sense that people want to put money into gold in order to protect their wealth heading into what could be a very long and dangerous weekend.",126.11202239990234

New Article Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if GLD shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for SPDR Gold Trust, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing GLD's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $184.00 strike highlighted in red: Considering the fact that the $184.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. Investors in SPDR Gold Trust (Symbol: GLD) saw new options become available today, for the July 28th expiration. New Article However, the U.S. consumer inflation report for May, scheduled for release on June 13 ahead of the Fed meeting, will offer investors a clearer picture of the world’s largest economy’s health. Despite a slight easing in the dollar index, which makes gold more affordable for investors using other currencies, the appeal of zero-yield bullion continues to diminish due to higher interest rates. Cautious Trade Ahead of CPI, Fed In conclusion, gold prices have seen a modest rise, supported by a weaker dollar, while investors eagerly await signals from the U.S. Federal Reserve. New Article If we do break to the upside, that is possible that we could make a move toward the $2000 level, which obviously will capture a lot of of attention. If that were to happen, it would almost certainly have something to do with a ton of US dollar strength, something that I don’t think we are going to see in the short term, simply due to the fact that central banks in general are very hawkish at the moment, and it’s not just the Federal Reserve.

Nearby Tone Determined by CPI, Fed News In conclusion, while gold prices experienced a slight dip, the overall outlook remains positive due to expectations of a potential pause on interest rate hikes by the U.S. central bank. New Article Geopolitical uncertainty and U.S. banking crisis provided material support to gold markets this year, but Fed’s hawkish policy was a big obstacle on the way to historic highs. In addition, high interest rates may trigger the second phase of the regional banking crisis in the U.S., as Fed’s policy puts too much pressure on the commercial real estate market.

Gold broke out to a new record high of 2,082 in early-May and was quickly met with resistance that turned price back down. Another attempt at new highs if not a sustained breakout is likely given the long-term bullish basing pattern that has been forming for more than 10 years. New Article All things being equal, this is a market that continues to be range bound and I think you need to wait to see whether or not we break higher or lower to determine where we go next.

New Article The 50-Day EMA is right in the middle of all of this, and I think at this point we are essentially in a major “holding pattern.” Being in a holding pattern makes quite a bit of sense due to the fact that we have the Federal Reserve statement on Wednesday, and of course we have the European Central Bank statement on Thursday.

Seasonally Lower Demand for Physical Gold Traders are now factoring in a roughly 72% probability of a Fed rate hike in July, according to the CME Fedwatch tool. While traders anticipate a July rate hike, the seasonally slow period for physical demand suggests a downward trend for gold prices, barring a significant slowdown in U.S. economic data. New Article It looks as if the Federal Reserve is likely to continue being ultra-tight with its monetary policy, and as rates rally in the bond market, it makes gold a little less attractive.

New Article Overview Gold prices were little-changed on Thursday amid renewed talks of interest rate hikes by the U.S. Federal Reserve, keeping the bullion near a three-month low. Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s remarks to lawmakers indicated the likelihood of further rate increases if the economy continues its current trajectory. Additionally, the Bank of England’s rate decision is highly anticipated following higher-than-expected inflation data, with market sentiment divided on the magnitude of the potential hike.

New Article Overview Comex Gold prices reached a near nine-week high on Thursday, driven by a weaker dollar and expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve may pause its interest rate hikes. As investors assess the Fed’s rate hike decisions and the employment data, gold remains an attractive investment option due to its safe-haven appeal and potential for hedging against inflationary pressures.

New Article Monitoring inflation trends and the performance of the US dollar is crucial for investors in thegold market Typically, gold maintains an inverse correlation with the greenback, although occasional deviations can occur. Lower interest rates narrow the gap between the storage costs for physical gold and the potential yield from holding bonds, thereby making precious metals more appealing. The 50-Day EMA continues to provide support, while key levels, such as the previous candlestick high and the $2000 mark, hold significance for potential breakouts.

Short-Term Outlook:  Cautiously Bearish With shifting dynamics in interest rates, inflation targets, and robust economic data, gold’s appeal faces challenges. New Article A more in-depth scrutiny of the chart leads me to discern a potential recovery on the horizon, and there’s a plausible argument to be made for the emergence of what traders refer to as a “double bottom.” The 200-Day EMA often captures broad attention as a pivotal trend gauge. Simultaneously, there’s the inverse connection with the US dollar, and the impending speeches by Christine Lagarde and Jerome Powell on Friday are poised to infuse substantial volatility into this arena.

Because of this, I think you get a situation where traders will continue to look at this through the prism of perhaps offering value, but you also need to keep in mind that there are some external factors out there worth paying attention to.

Conservative investors have often turned to GLD for its stability to hedge against inflation, currency fluctuations, and overall market volatility. New Article Trendline Breakout Today’s rally in gold sent it above the downtrend line that begins from the last peak prior to the top of the recent correction, and it will likely close above it for the first time. A pullback will come but the higher price rises before that happens the more confidence it creates that the rally is sustainable and that today’s breakout of the trendline confirms the end of the correction. If subsequent price action continues to support that thesis, then traders will be watching for bullish setups during weakness.

Sept 21 (Reuters) - Gold prices retreated on Thursday as the U.S. dollar and bond yields powered higher after the Federal Reserve signalled another rate hike this year and a tighter monetary policy through 2024 than previously expected. * The U.S. dollar index .DXY climbed 0.4% to its highest since March 9, while two-year Treasury yields rose to 17-year high after the Fed held interest rates steady on Wednesday but stiffened a hawkish monetary policy stance. New Article Potential Impacts and Predictions According to a note from NAB Commodities Research, gold prices might face a downward push if the Federal Reserve adopts a tougher stance, especially in light of the recent August U.S. CPI and PPI data releases. Market Sentiment and Additional Dynamics The financial community’s spotlight remains squarely on the Federal Reserve’s forthcoming policy meeting, which is expected to provide clarity on interest rate prospects and broader economic forecasts. Short-Term Forecast In sum, the balance of probabilities indicates a continued hawkish lean from the Fed, aiming to nudge inflation towards its 2% goal – a scenario not particularly favorable for gold. New Article However, the sustainability of this upward trend remains uncertain, primarily due to the impending Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting scheduled for later Wednesday. While the consensus does not predict an interest rate hike, the real question revolves around whether the Federal Reserve will persist with its tight stance or exhibit signs of hesitancy.

In that case, a rally above today’s high of 1,880 shows strength and could see gold continue higher in the short term.

""While there is an attempt for gold prices to stabilize into today's session, there is not much conviction of a reversal just yet,"" IG market strategist Yeap Jun Rong said. New Article Echoing investor demand, SPDR Gold Trust GLD, the world's largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, said its holdings fell to its lowest since August 2019 on Wednesday. By Harshit Verma Oct 5 (Reuters) - Gold prices held steady on Thursday as Treasury yields pulled back from 16-year highs and investors awaited U.S. jobs data for more clarity on the Federal Reserve's interest rate path. GOL/ETF ""Over the past few weeks gold really took a tumble, the big driver for that appears to be the rise in long term US interest rates,"" said Edward Gardner, commodities economist at Capital Economics. New Article Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if GLD shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for SPDR Gold Trust, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing GLD's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $172.00 strike highlighted in red: Considering the fact that the $172.00 strike represents an approximate 2% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. Investors in SPDR Gold Trust (Symbol: GLD) saw new options begin trading today, for the November 24th expiration. New Article The Fed began raising interest rates in March 2022 and shows no signs of easing off, thereby making gold—an asset that provides no yield—less attractive. The recent decrease in 10-year bond yields and a softer dollar has somewhat relieved pressure on gold, but not enough to signal a bullish market. However, it’s worth noting that the current Daily price did see a slight uptick from the previous close of 1821.32, suggesting minor bullish activity in an otherwise bearish landscape. New Article SPDR Gold Trust GLD, the world's largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, said its holdings hit the lowest levels since August 2019 on Thursday. By Swati Verma Oct 6 (Reuters) - Gold edged up from seven-month lows on Friday, as the U.S. dollar and bond yields took a breather after scaling new highs this week ahead of U.S. non-farm payrolls data. Federal Reserve officials on Thursday indicated little concern that the recent rise in U.S. Treasury yields could imperil a ""soft landing"" for the economy, and said it could actually help the central bank fight inflation. New Article * SPDR Gold Trust GLD, the world's largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, said its holdings fell 0.2% to 867.58 metric tons on Thursday, their lowest since August 2019. Oct 6 (Reuters) - Gold paused near a seven-month low on Friday after declining for nine straight sessions, as investors held their breath for U.S. nonfarm payrolls data that could determine whether interest rates will be raised again. * Benchmark U.S. 10-year bond yields held near 16-year highs and the U.S. dollar .DXY remained on track for 12 straight weeks of gains, eroding demand for non-yielding and greenback-priced gold. New Article While I don’t necessarily think that will be easy in the short term, you need to keep in mind that Friday is the jobs number in the United States, and that could have a major influence on what goes on in the bond markets. In other words, it very well could be a catalyst for interest rates to continue interfering with gold and any attempt at a rally.

By Anjana Anil Oct 6 (Reuters) - Gold prices were stuck in a tight range on Friday, hovering near seven-month lows, as investors held back from making big bets ahead of U.S. non-farm payrolls data that could influence the Federal Reserve interest rate path. Stubborn inflation meant interest rates would have to remain ""higher for longer"" and economic fragmentation threatened to hit emerging and developing economies hardest, IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva said on Thursday. New Article Simultaneously, the SPDR Gold Trust ETF is registering its lowest holdings since August 2019, indicating that rallies are likely driven by short-covering rather than genuine buying. The market lacks the conviction for a definitive move, and only a significant technical reversal supported by high trading volumes could inject some bullish sentiment.

New Article For gold, traditionally seen as an inflation hedge, higher interest rates could increase the opportunity cost of holding the metal, potentially dampening its appeal. This perspective aligns with recent comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell and other officials, who have expressed uncertainty about the adequacy of current rates in combating inflation. Meanwhile, Moody’s recent downgrade of the U.S. credit outlook adds to the complex economic backdrop although the current price action suggests investors are treating it as a non-event. New Article The support zone is considered a little stronger than it might be given the confirmation from the 50-Day line, which points to a similar price level. Of course, it is not clear yet whether the recent 1,932 swing low will be tested again as support or fail to hold another selloff. Therefore, there is a good chance that short-term weakness will be bought by traders looking to enter the market to take advantage of the next swing up. New Article Alternatively, I think gold markets are in the midst of stabilizing after a reasonable pullback, as we had shot straight up in the air previously. Keep in mind that the gold markets are going to be paying close attention to the interest rate situation in the United States, and of course geopolitical concerns such as the war in the Gaza Strip.

With that, I think it is going to take another fundamental move for gold to finally break out, but right now I would not be interested in shorting, I think rather you are more likely than not going to see shorter-term back and forth trading and therefore longer term traders may struggle for a bit of clarity.

New Article This uptick comes as market sentiments lean towards the belief that the U.S. Federal Reserve might halt its interest rate hikes, influencing the dollar and Treasury yields. Moreover, a significant drop in producer prices, the largest in over three years, alongside rising unemployment claims, seem to support the Fed’s inflation control efforts. Despite Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s hints at possible future hikes, the market is increasingly leaning towards a rate hold in the upcoming December meeting. New Article Rally Back Above 1,988 Shows Strength If a bearish continuation signal does not trigger, then watch for a possible attempt to go higher before a pullback. If gold can rally back to above yesterday’s high of 1,988 and stay above it, there is the capacity to keep rising thereby negating today’s signs of weakness.

By Harshit Verma Nov 20 (Reuters) - Gold prices were off last session's two-week highs on Monday as U.S. Treasury yields bounced back, with investors looking forward to the minutes of Federal Reserve's last meeting to gauge the U.S. central bank's policy stance.

New Article The 50-Day EMA could be a significant amount of support based on technical analysis, and I think it’s probably only a matter of time before we see buyers jumping into the market to pick up “cheap gold.” That being said, the bond markets are all over the place these days, so keep an eye on the yield coming out of the 10 year note in America. The shooting star from the Friday session was the beginning of the first signs of overextension, and now it’s likely that we have a little bit of profit-taking.

Overall, the short-term forecast for gold prices appears bullish, underpinned by expectations of U.S. interest rate cuts, a weaker dollar, and ongoing geopolitical tensions.

The current market environment suggests a window of opportunity for gold to benefit if the Fed signals any easing in its rate hike strategy. The overall market sentiment for gold, considering its position relative to these technical indicators, leans towards bullishness, with the possibility of continued upward movement if it maintains above the minor support level. New Article I think a lot of what we are seeing now is a question being asked of the interest rate markets, and therefore we need to pay close attention to whether or not they rise or fall. Short-term pullbacks should be a buying opportunity, and I think a lot of people will look at that as an opportunity to pick up “cheap gold.” Underneath, the market will continue to see a lot of volatility, but I do think at this point in time gold is trying to make a move based upon not only interest rates, but the geopolitical issues that we face around the world.

New Article Gold will be moved by interest rates falling, but more importantly, a lot of geopolitical concerns as the markets seem to be all over the place when it comes to pricing in the latest headlines. The economy could slow down, and that might help gold as it takes the interest rate pressures off of the metal market, but at the same time, simple momentum has shown itself to be a major factor here. Either way, there’s no real argument for shorting this market off of the weekly chart at the moment, but it doesn’t necessarily look like it’s ready to go busting out right away either. New Article When combined with price action of the past prior two days a small potential bullish pennant appears. Given that a breakout above the trend high is relatively close to the first target zone mentioned above, if momentum is strong enough gold could breeze right through it.

New Article Underneath, the $2000 level will continue to attract a certain amount of attention, as it is a large, round, psychologically significant figure.

The anticipation of monetary easing and lower interest rates is driving investment demand for gold, as investors seek to capitalize on the non-interest-bearing asset’s potential gains.

In general, I think this is a situation where you will continue to see a lot of noisy behavior, and the fact that Friday has the Non-Farm Payroll announcement coming out, and that of course will move interest rates quite drastically in the United States, which will have its knock on effect here in thegold market Beyond that though, we also have a lot of geopolitical concerns out there that could drive gold higher, so keep an eye on all of that.

New Article While the Federal Reserve’s rate decision is highly anticipated, its stance might be more conservative than the dovish market expectations, leading to cautious trading in gold. These elements, along with the anticipated steadiness or decrease in interest rates, are expected to significantly impact gold’s short-term price movement. The recent subdued price activity underscores the necessity for bullion traders to grasp the Federal Reserve’s policy direction clearly to establish robust market support. New Article Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s comments about the potential end of rate hikes and a shift towards cutting borrowing costs have influenced market sentiment, contributing to a softer dollar and lower Treasury yields. The combination of the Fed’s pivot, lower Treasury yields, and a weaker dollar, coupled with global central bank interest rate decisions, presents a conducive environment for gold’s continued rise. The market sentiment, as reflected by these technical indicators, leans towards bullishness, with an eye on the resistance level for further upside potential. New Article Ultimately, I think that as we head toward the end of the year, there’s probably some position squaring going on as well, and of course there is a bit of fear in the market due to the massive turnaround that we saw last Monday. With that being said, pay attention to the US dollar, interest rates, and of course risk appetite to determine what happens next in thegold market The next day or 2 could be very noisy, but after that we will more likely than not settle down into a vibe heading into the holidays.

With that being the case, short-term pullbacks will end up being buying opportunities, and therefore I look at them as possibly buying opportunities to pick up “cheap gold.” In general, it is very likely that the interest rates in America continue to give gold a little bit of a boost, and therefore I think it’s a situation where it is probably only a matter of time before the buyers come back into this picture and continue to push.

In general, this is a market that has seen extreme amounts of volatility, therefore it’s likely that we are going to see choppiness, and as we head into the holiday season, there will be a lot of concerns about liquidity anyway.

New Article A bearish continuation signal was triggered initially with a drop below the prior retracement low of 1,976. Notice that potential support at the prior swing high of 2,009 was quickly surpassed, reflecting strong demand today. Since upward momentum is starting off today’s low, strong demand may not be able to sustain itself into new record highs without at least a short pullback or consolidation phase first. New Article The prevailing opinion among Wall Street experts is that the Fed will hold the current interest rate steady at 5.25% to 5.50%, signaling a phase of stabilization following a series of substantial hikes since March 2022. Notably, futures market data, including insights from the CME Group’s FedWatch Tool, indicate a roughly 40% chance of the first rate cut by the Fed occurring in March 2024. The decision, complemented by the Fed’s policy statement, dot plots, and Chair Jerome Powell’s remarks, is set to critically shape the short-term trends in Treasury yields, the US Dollar, gold, and the stock market.",122.70072937011719

Worst case scenario, we bounce around between here and there, but I still believe that the buyers have the upper hand going into 2024, especially as the Federal Reserve will not be the only central bank to start cutting rates.

The Fed’s balanced approach towards its dual mandate of stable prices and maximum employment, along with Powell’s hint at a potential “soft landing,” played a pivotal role in shaping market expectations. In summary, gold’s performance in the coming weeks will hinge significantly on the Fed’s policy direction, Treasury yield movements, and the US dollar’s strength.",122.16342163085938

All things being equal, I do think that eventually we go looking to the $2075 level, which is the top of the body from the candlestick just prior to the massive liquidity drain that we had seen at the beginning of December.
