By Ernest Scheyder Jan 14 (Reuters) - Members of Arizona's San Carlos Apache tribe filed a property lien on Thursday in an attempt to regain control over land that the U.S. government is poised to give to Rio Tinto Ltd RIO.AXRIO.L for the Resolution Copper mine. The mine could supply a quarter of U.S. copper demand if developed, but eventually destroy the land, known as Oak Flat, or Chi'chil Bildagotee, considered by Native Americans to be the home of religious deities. New Article Jan 14 (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Thursday denied a request by Native Americans to block the Trump administration from publishing an environmental study that would trigger a land swap needed by Rio Tinto Ltd RIO.AXRIO.L to build a copper mine in Arizona. U.S. District Judge Steven Logan said in his ruling that because tribal representatives were not able to contact U.S. government attorneys on Wednesday to indicate they were filing a temporary restraining order, the court will not approve the restraining order. The judge said that just because the study is published does not necessarily mean the land swap will actually go through, even though the U.S. Congress mandated just that in 2014. New Article By Fabian Cambero SANTIAGO, Jan 14 (Reuters) - Global miner BHP BHP.AX will be forced to suspend operations at its Cerro Colorado copper mine in water-parched northern Chile after the country's Supreme Court upheld local indigenous communities' complaint about the project's water use.

U.S. District Judge Steven Logan declined to issue a restraining order that would have prevented the government from publishing the environmental study as planned on Friday, a step that would start a 60-day countdown to transfer the land to Rio Tinto.",63.22158432006836

Adds details on impairment charge, special dividend, background Aug 19 (Reuters) - Australian diversified miner South32 Ltd S32.AX on Thursday posted a 153% rise in its annual underlying profit, boosted by higher realised prices for its key commodities as demand bounced back with economies reopening. Easing curbs and a rebound in industrial activity powered prices of the miner's metallurgical coal, aluminium and manganese in the latter half of 2020, helping it offset a $728 million impairment charge on its flagship Illawarra project. New Article By Clyde Russell LAUNCESTON, Australia, Aug 19 (Reuters) - The market hasn't exactly cheered BHP Group's BHPB.LBHP.AX proposed exit from its oil and gas business, with shares of both the mining giant and the acquirer, Woodside Petroleum WPL.AX, tumbling in the wake of deal. However, BHP may still battle to win over climate-sensitive investors given its status as the world's biggest exporter of coking coal, the polluting fuel used to make steel. A point of concern for investors is that BHP may have sold the assets too cheaply, and that getting only Woodside shares as payment is less than desirable. New Article By Fabian Cambero SANTIAGO, Aug 18 (Reuters) - An historic benefits package at BHP's BHP.AX sprawling Escondida copper mine has raised the prospect for tough new negotiations and strikes at mines around the country, workers and analysts told Reuters. That includes Codelco's flagship El Teniente mine, its smaller El Salvador and Ministro Hales mines, BHP's Cerro Colorado, Anglo American's AAL.L El Soldado and KGHM's KGH.WA Sierra Gorda. Success at the bargaining table was driven by soaring copper prices, which broke records earlier this year and have remained high enough to whet workers' appetite for raises, bonuses and a bigger slice of profits. New Article SAO PAULO, Aug 18 (Reuters) - Brazilian prosecutors asked on Wednesday a bankruptcy court to compel miners Vale SA VALE3.SA and BHP Group BHP.AX to pay 50.7 billion reais ($9.47 billion) in debts of their joint-venture Samarco, according to a court document reviewed by Reuters. Samarco filed for bankruptcy protection in April as it failed to restructure its debt after a dam burst at a mine in 2015 killing 19 people and releasing a giant torrent of sludge. Prosecutors consider Samarco's shareholders are responsible for the disaster and required a restraining order to cover for the company's debt.

In the case of BHP Group Ltd, the RSI reading has hit 26.9 — by comparison, the universe of metals and mining stocks covered by Metals Channel currently has an average RSI of 41.2, the RSI of Spot Gold is at 51.4, and the RSI of Spot Silver is presently 34.5. New Article By Sonali Paul and Melanie Burton MELBOURNE, Aug 18 (Reuters) - Shares in BHP Group BHP.AX and Woodside Petroleum WPL.AX fell on Wednesday as investors on both sides raised questions about the value of the Perth-based oil and gas group's proposed $29 billion merger with BHP's petroleum arm. Analysts were upbeat about the long term for Woodside, saying the deal would give it more growth options, beyond its $12 billion Scarborough gas project and Pluto LNG expansion, funded by strong cash generation at BHP's debt-free assets. While a 6% fall in BHP's share price was linked to a decision to end its UK dual listing, where its shares have traditionally traded at a large discount, a fall of up to 4% in Woodside reflected concerns about the expansion, they said. New Article By Carolina Mandl and Marta Nogueira SAO PAULO/RIO, Aug 18 (Reuters) - Brazilian prosecutors on Wednesday asked a bankruptcy court to compel miners Vale SA VALE3.SA and BHP Group BHP.AX to fully pay offtheir Samarco joint venture's 50.7 billion reais ($9.47 billion) debt, according to a court document reviewed by Reuters. Vale, BHP and Samarco did not immediately comment on the matter, but in the past, the companies companies have argued that the joint-venture itself is responsible for all such liabilities. Samarco filed for bankruptcy protection in April as it struggled to restructure its debt, which it stopped servicing after a dam burst at a mine in 2015 killing 19 people, releasing a giant torrent of sludge and halting production. New Article BHP Group Ltd. (BHP) was still declining by more than 5%, adding to the previous session's losses, after the company and Woodside Petroleum announced an all-stock merger deal to combine their oil and gas portfolios.
