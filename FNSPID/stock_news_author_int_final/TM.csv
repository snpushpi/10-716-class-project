New Article Ford Motor Company ( F ) reported a pre-tax profit of $138 million in Europe in the third quarter of fiscal year 2016. While this gain might not sound so significant, its importance is underscored when these numbers are placed alongside the company's unit sales and revenue performance compared to last year's third quarter. However, the company is now on track to achieve a strong sales mix in the rest of the region and has managed to cut costs significantly. New Article In comparison, Honda's highest selling SUV CR-V has seen its sales only increase by 1.8% so far this year. The success of the HR-V is a strong pointer to the company that it could have sold more units of the CR-V in the U.S. had it not been for a supply shortage.

New Article The group announced previously that it is cutting investment by €1 billion ($1.08 billion) a year at its namesake brand, which is weighing down the group's net profitability, as high capital spending and R&D investments have kept operating margins below 3% at the brand. One of the key areas for cost cuts is at the namesake brand of passenger vehicles, which forms ~60% of the net unit sales for the group. The brand's margin stood at 1.6% through Q3, down from 2.8% a year ago, due to added expenses, lower sales, and discounts and incentives offered in view of the dieselgate scandal, lowering the group's overall operating margin to 7% in the first three quarters of the year (the figure excludes special items that comprise provisions for the emissions issue).",116.3578872680664

Apart from Mercedes-Benz and Lincoln, sales of the luxury brands of all major auto makers have declined on a year-over-year basis in this year. The worrying thing for Lexus is that sales of almost all car models of the brand have declined in high double digit rates. New Article Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) said that its U.S. sales rose 5% in November, a good result aided by a quirk of the calendar and strong demand over the Black Friday weekend.

But while it was a good month on balance, not everything is working well for the General at the moment: GM's full-size pickups, the Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra, sold a combined 60,004 units in May, down 4.2% from a year ago. But it's something to watch: Too-high inventories could mean that GM's sales expectations were too optimistic, and that it might have to resort to heavier discounting (along with those plant closures) to clear out excess vehicles. New Article Ford's per-vehicle spending on incentives was roughly flat overall from a year ago in May, and was actually down modestly on the F-Series pickups ($500) and on Ford-brand car models ($300). One of the board's concerns: Ford's adjusted EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) profit margin in North America fell to 8.3% in the first quarter from 12.9% a year ago, while rival GM managed a healthy 11.7% . If so, Ford's decision to go against the industry grain, by keeping inventories trim and discounts restrained, could turn out to look pretty smart in retrospect. New Article In April, a Toyota Motor Corp (ADR) (NYSE: TM ) executive predicted an industry-wide decline going forward. As such, investors expecting a quick return to glory for the company, or a sharp rebound in Ford stock, under new CEO Jim Hackett are likely to be disappointed. A Ford Turnaround Won't Be Easy Or Quick Much of the coverage surrounding Hackett has focused on his efforts at the University of Michigan, and his tenure at Steelcase Inc. (NYSE: SCS ). New Article Amid increasing signs that the U.S. new-car market is softening, May was a mixed month for the ""big three"" Japanese automakers, Toyota (NYSE: TM) , Honda (NYSE: HMC) , and Nissan (NASDAQOTH: NSANY) . But Toyota also has a range of well-regarded (and competitively priced) crossovers, and more recently, has been able to increase production of them to meet surging demand, largely offsetting its sedans' declines. Honda's story in the U.S. over the last couple of years has been similar to Toyota's: A buyer migration away from its longtime mainstay sedans -- the small Fit, compact Civic, and midsize Accord -- and toward crossover SUVs that it struggled to supply in sufficient numbers. New Article A few years ago, FCA CEO Sergio Marchionne made a big and costly bet : That a big investment in a slew of new products for the Alfa Romeo brand could give the company a high-margin global luxury contender. That slightly trails both Ford and GM, as well as Volkswagen -- which benefits in this case from its upscale Audi and Porsche brands -- but is well ahead of other mass-market automakers. FCA has made good progress , but the reality is that it started from further behind: It has a lot more debt than Ford or GM, or most of its other global rivals, and a less robust new-product pipeline.",115.22086334228516

For the six months ended September 2017, Toyota Motors had reported a decline of 20.3 billion yen in its operating income due to an increase in marketing activities and other expenses. Toyota is taking several measures to adapt to the changing trends in the automotive industry, where passenger cars are no longer in high demand. New Article For comparison, Toyota 's (NYSE: TM) margin in its fiscal 2017 was 7.2% , and General Motors ' (NYSE: GM) was 7.5% in 2016 . Given that, I asked Ford's chief financial officer, Bob Shanks, if the lower margin we saw in 2017 is the ""new normal"" -- something that investors should expect to live with for a while. Shanks said the rising costs of key commodities is one reason why CEO Jim Hackett is so focused on improving the ""fitness"" of Ford's business. New Article Toyota Motor ( TM ) sales more than doubled estimates. [ibd-display-video id=3120212 width=50 float=left autostart=true] Ford and Fiat Chrysler reported sizable declines vs. a year earlier, while GM's advance was less than expected. Last year, core earnings rose 18% to 1.04 billion euros, the Italian sports car maker reported Thursday.",144.5547332763672

I doubt production figures will change investor sentiment all that much: both bulls and bears are firmly dug in when it comes to Tesla stock. On the other hand, if Tesla can convince investors that the Model 3 is headed in the right direction, with deliveries climbing and production scaling, a key pillar of the near-term bear case gets knocked out. New Article Heck, even Toyota (NYSE: TM) , which until recently has been known for its success with passenger cars rather than larger vehicles, posted a huge 17% total sales gain in January, thanks to its light trucks. Before investors get too excited about a potential boost from high-margin truck sales, consider that analysts also believe any gains from tax reform will be partially or entirely offset by a likely rise in interest rates in March.
