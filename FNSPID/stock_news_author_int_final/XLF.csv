In David's comment, asking the question he talked about the work involved with individual stocks and I agree that most people will not want to put in the time needed to monitor a portfolio of stocks, and the bigger point is that even if someone puts in the hours, there is no guarantee that they will add value with the work they do; David's context is individual investors managing their own portfolios.",20.316852569580078

As you can see, XLF has struggled since then, consistently underperforming the S&P 500 tracking ETF, SPY.

Below is a chart showing XLF's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $26.00 strike highlighted in red: Considering the fact that the $26.00 strike represents an approximate 4% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.
