Shareholders of Comcast Corp (Symbol: CMCSA) looking to boost their income beyond the stock's 1.6% annualized dividend yield can sell the January 2017 covered call at the $72.50 strike and collect the premium based on the $2.19 bid, which annualizes to an additional 2.4% rate of return against the current stock price (at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost ), for a total of 4% annualized rate in the scenario where the stock is not called away. Any upside above $72.50 would be lost if the stock rises there and is called away, but CMCSA shares would have to climb 16.3% from current levels for that to occur, meaning that in the scenario where the stock is called, the shareholder has earned a 19.8% return from this trading level, in addition to any dividends collected before the stock was called.

New Article Below is a chart showing CMCSA's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $72.50 strike highlighted in red: The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the January 2018 covered call at the $72.50 strike gives good reward for the risk of having given away the upside beyond $72.50. Shareholders of Comcast Corp (Symbol: CMCSA) looking to boost their income beyond the stock's 1.8% annualized dividend yield can sell the January 2018 covered call at the $72.50 strike and collect the premium based on the $2.86 bid, which annualizes to an additional 2.8% rate of return against the current stock price (at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost ), for a total of 4.5% annualized rate in the scenario where the stock is not called away. Any upside above $72.50 would be lost if the stock rises there and is called away, but CMCSA shares would have to climb 15.7% from current levels for that to occur, meaning that in the scenario where the stock is called, the shareholder has earned a 20.2% return from this trading level, in addition to any dividends collected before the stock was called.",40.70390701293945

New Article Verizon (NYSE: VZ) wants to find a merger partner and it's not being shy about making it known to Comcast (NASDAQ: CMCSA) , Disney , or any other big player that might be willing.

New Article So let's consider three stocks -- AT&T (NYSE: T) , Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) , and Comcast (NASDAQ: CMCSA) -- that are stable enough picks that they should provide investors with returns regardless of the state of the market. Though its shares have dramatically underperformed the market this year, AT&T's pending purchase of Time Warner should help the company move toward introducing an over-the-top cable service that streams content to mobile devices.

The government's main argument against the AT&T-Time Warner merger was that vertical integration -- letting the same company own substantial delivery and content assets -- would result in higher prices for consumers. Having to compete with deep-pocketed Comcast may result in the ""winner's curse"" -- an economic term denoting the tendency for a winning auction bid to exceed the true value of the assets won.

What happened Class A shares of Twenty-First Century Fox (NASDAQ: FOXA) (NASDAQ: FOX) were up 7.1% as of noon EDT Wednesday after Disney (NYSE: DIS) signed an amended agreement to acquire the entertainment conglomerate for $38 per share in cash and stock, for an equity value of $71.3 billion -- a hefty premium over Disney's previous $52.4 billion bid .

New Article Comcast (NASDAQ: CMCSA) has notably taken steps to improve its user interface and on-demand selection with its X1 platform. TV Everywhere apps are still clunky and don't always work outside the house, and the on-demand selection of most cable services is wanting. Adding to that is the constantly improving content library featuring hundreds of original series, films, and comedy specials. New Article ( Reuters ) The love triangle between Twenty-first Century Fox ( FOXA ), Walt Disney ( DIS ), and Comcast ( CMCSA ) may be nearing its end, as Fox shareholders have decided to vote on Disney's $71.3 billion offer on July 27. The Dow ended today modestly higher, thanks to a massive post-earnings rally from apparel giant Nike ( NKE ) -- but the index once again failed to reclaim its 200-day moving average , as an intraday gain of 293 points largely evaporated by the close. Plus, Constellation Brands whiffs on earnings; XLF options volume pops; and a drug stock sliding on FDA news. New Article But it was nearly inevitable that Comcast (NASDAQ: CMCSA) would come back with another raise, and according to The Wall Street Journal , it's gathering the ammo in the form of financing to the tune of $90 billion. In this episode of MarketFoolery , host Chris Hill and senior analyst Andy Cross have a pair of merger deals on their minds: One complex and still up in the air, the other simpler but less certain to deliver the goods. With the explosion of ETFs and the so-called efficient market theory and funds out there -- many of which under-perform -- the individual investor who is truly trying to find great businesses and buy and hold them for many years, and do it in a diversified way, and have a lot of fun with that, we are still a minority out there. New Article But it was nearly inevitable that Comcast (NASDAQ: CMCSA) would come back with another raise. In this segment of this MarketFoolery podcast, host Chris Hill and Motley Fool senior analyst Andy Cross consider the recent Wall Street Journal report that, before it makes that next bid, it's gathering ammo in the form of financing to the tune of $90 billion. Chris Hill: I was looking through my notes and noticed that the last two Wednesday episodes of MarketFoolery started with us talking about the whole Disney, Fox, Comcast thing.

It is to suggest, however, that an awful lot of questions remain regarding exactly how AT&T is going to stand out in an increasingly crowded streaming video industry when most consumers still don’t recognize the brand the way they do Netflix, CBS or Disney.

The platform provides access to top streaming apps including Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, HBO, Showtime, YouTube, Amazon Music, Pandora, iHeartRadio and soon Peacock and Hulu. New Article Adding insult to injury, Comcast (NASDAQ:) announced they would provide a free Xfinity Flex streaming box to its internet-only subscribers. The meteoric ascent for ROKU stock was bound to succumb to gravity, but this certainly isn’t the type of mean reversion shareholders were hoping for. Two narratives driving the stock this month were the recent disclosure of a $3.2 billion investment in AT&T by activist investor Elliot Management Corp., and yesterday’s revealing AT&T was “exploring parting with its DirecTV unit.” As far as options trading goes, calls outpaced puts by a wide margin, accounting for 70% of Wednesday’s tally. New Article Roku (NASDAQ: ROKU) stock plummeted after Comcast (NASDAQ: CMCSA) announced its internet subscribers are now eligible to receive a free Xfinity Flex streaming box and Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) introduced its new Portal TV device. The social giant's Portal TV is also heavily focused on pushing users to its messaging apps, Messenger and WhatsApp, which provide the back end for its core video-calling feature. But even if literally every one of Comcast's 27.8 million high-speed internet customers started using Flex devices, it still wouldn't catch up to Roku's user base, and engagement would likely be significantly lower. New Article Shares of Roku (NASDAQ:) officially entered bear market territory yesterday, dropping over 20% from the recent highs at the $170 area. This type of aggressive call buying likely means some big-time player is positioning for a pop in the ROKU stock price. So to position to be a buyer of ROKU at even lower levels, an out-of-the-money bull put spread makes strategic sense. New Article And Comcast's (NASDAQ: CMCSA) NBCUniversal streaming service could be a serious contender next year, with Comcast controlling a significant presence in Europe thanks to its Sky acquisition last year. It isn't the high valuation that's kept me away (even though the company sports a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 52), nor the torrid growth of expenses to stock up on and create content (a negative free cash flow of $594 million in the second quarter of 2019 alone). Don't underestimate the field It could be easy to write off the mounting competition and say Netflix will be fine, because it has enjoyed such a big head start in the world of streaming TV. New Article 'The Office' was recalled by NBCUniversal (NASDAQ: CMCSA), which paid $500 million to get back the streaming rights from Netflix, while 'Friends' was recalled by WarnerMedia (NYSE: T), which paid $425 million for the streaming rights. On Monday, investors woke up to the news that Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) had secured the global streaming rights for Seinfeld, the iconic TV show whose popularity hasn't waned since its premiere over 30 years ago. This latest move indicates that Netflix is willing to acquire outside shows in order to remain competitive even as it continues to invest heavily in original content, which is likely to pay off.

The company isn't likely to win any awards for most-loved brand in America anytime soon, but its stable of internet, communications, and entertainment services makes this a value stock worth owning in good economic times and bad. If you could only focus on one thing... Comcast breaks its earnings results, which were released Thursday, into three basic segments: cable communications, NBCUniversal, and Sky (the British and European broadcaster it purchased in 2018). New Article Cable giant Comcast (NASDAQ: CMCSA) reported third-quarter results early Thursday morning. The company continued to transform from an old-school cable-TV specialist into a provider of high-speed internet connectivity and related services, all without missing a beat in the never-ending quest for earnings and revenue growth. What management wanted to say Comcast CEO Brian Roberts spent a generous portion of the earnings call discussing the Xfinity Flex entertainment portal. New Article Disney is building its new streaming brand on its established media properties, and Netflix is staring down the prospect of facing off against Star Wars and Marvel Studios armed with little more than the promise of future seasons of Stranger Things. Like Apple -- and unlike the media companies creating their own services, which include Comcast, NBCUniversal, and AT&T's WarnerMedia -- Netflix needs to rely on investing big bucks in original content that will, it hopes, be the next Stranger Things or something like rival HBO's Game of Thrones. That could be the most interesting variable in this whole equation: Can Netflix land classic IP that helps it stand up to Star Wars, Marvel Studios, and the rest of Disney's nostalgia-laden fan favorites?

New Article By Andrew Walker, CFA: I spend a lot of time looking at and thinking about the cable/telecom/media sectors, and you can’t spend any time on either of those without thinking about/looking at Comcast (CMCSA) given their ownership of Xfinity (the largest cable company in the U.S.) and NBC (one of the largest media companies in the U.S.). ), almost all of the NBC assets are undergoing some form of extreme secular headwind and/or Corona disruption, and there are more than a few red flags related to corporate governance that I think bulls tend to overlook. None of those are insurmountable problems from a valuation standpoint, but they do make the simple SOTP “how cheap is the cable business” model worthless. New Article This is about more than just sports leagues and fans -- it's also about pay-TV companies like AT&T (NYSE: T), Comcast (NASDAQ: CMCSA), and Altice (NYSE: ATUS), as well as sports networks like Disney's (NYSE: DIS) ESPN, Comcast's NBC Sports Network, and Fox Corporation's (NASDAQ: FOXA) (NASDAQ: FOX) FS1, as well as regional networks owned by these companies and others.

New Article But Comcast Corp CMCSA.O jumped after it reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter revenue, as broadband demand continued to offset pandemic-related weakness in its theme park and filmed entertainment businesses. By Chuck Mikolajczak NEW YORK, Jan 28 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks closed higher on Thursday, bouncing from sharp losses in the prior session, thanks to a broad rally as earnings season got off to a strong start and fears lessened around hedge funds selling long positions to cover shorts. ""Trading platforms are not going to want to stick their necks out and be on the frontline of what they may see as a reckless war, in part, against the elite and the system of Wall Street that's being democratized by information and the social media,"" said Eric Schiffer, chief executive officer of private equity firm the Patriarch Organization. New Article On a day when Disney competitor Comcast (NASDAQ: CMCSA) reported subscription data on its Peacock streaming service, Disney announced its Star app content will be added to international Disney+ subscriptions, though with a price increase in some locations. The company said today that it was adding its international Star app content for Disney+ subscribers outside the U.S. starting on Feb. 23, reports media website CNET. Adding to the income stream from an already successful Disney+ launch has investors realizing that when other pandemic-impacted segments recover, there is much more potential from Disney's collection of businesses. New Article What happened Shares of media giant Comcast (NASDAQ: CMCSA) were 8% higher at 3 p.m. EST on Thursday, following the release of a solid fourth-quarter earnings report in the early morning. Management expects better financial results in 2021 as vaccines start to roll back the business restrictions on movie theaters and theme parks, among other suffering segments. At the same time, I'm worried that the financial damage of the pandemic hasn't been fully incorporated in these surging share prices, and I would love to know more about Peacock's paid versus free sign-ups.",38.94916915893555

On the bottom line, non-GAAP (adjusted) net income suffered a steeper fall, tumbling almost 29% to a shade below $2.62 billion, or $0.56 per share. Comcast described the performance of its considerable cable properties as ""outstanding,"" while pointing out that two of its Universal theme parks in Japan and Florida shed their red ink by reaching breakeven. New Article Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA), Charter Communications (NASDAQ:CHTR) and DISH Network (NASDAQ:DISH) may have teamed up to buy a competitive 5G spectrum position, albeit at nosebleed prices. T Stock and the Video Disaster While the numbers beat estimates, with analysts calling it a “good quarter,”  shares only briefly touched $30 before returning to their pre-earnings price. It’s now clear that former CEO Randall Stephenson buying DirecTv, and later, WarnerMedia, were among the biggest business mistakes of the 21st century. New Article The cash-rich business generated $5.3 billion in free cash flow over the trailing 12 months, and if that trend keeps up, it may only be a matter of time before it makes a big move to grow its operations. With fuboTV, users can watch top networks like ABC, FOX, and NBC, and also enjoy many different sporting events on its platform, giving cord-cutters a more comprehensive option than a streaming service like Netflix which only offers on-demand movies and TV shows. With some impressive growth numbers and still many opportunities ahead for fuboTV in both streaming and sports betting, this is a stock that could become a hot buy and make you rich. New Article Comcast (NASDAQ: CMCSA) offered up its fourth-quarter results on Friday. With all three companies operating popular theme park attractions in Florida and California, Comcast offers a glimpse of what its two rivals may bring to the table next month. Remove that line item, and Comcast's theme park segment was in the black on an adjusted EBITDA basis, even with Universal Studios Hollywood still shuttered. New Article In this episode of MarketFoolery, host Chris hill is joined by Motley Fool analyst Bill Barker to discuss the latest news in the market. Barker: Yeah, and there was a happy marriage, I suppose, at the time between GE's ownership of NBC and CNBC and his ability to appear and have lavish praise bestowed upon him on the major distributor of business news. I did like a tiny bit of research on one aspect of one of these quarterbacks, and that was, are there points that people would give or take away today from Tom Brady about his relationship with the former President Trump? New Article Comcast (CMCSA) posted earnings of $0.56 per share in 4Q beating analysts’ estimates of $0.48. Following the earnings results, Rosenblatt Securities analyst Bernie McTernan raised the stock's price target from $56 to $60 and reiterated a Buy rating. “The key takeaway from earnings is the company will be resuming buybacks earlier than expected, showing confidence in their ability to de-lever post-pandemic,"" McTernan wrote in a research note to investors.",40.07756423950195

Blue Man Group came to Universal Orlando's shopping and entertainment district eight years after Comcast rival Disney (NYSE: DIS) brought in Cirque du Soleil for its own high-end pageantry of acrobatic feats. The former Blue Man Group building could be refashioned into a year-round haunted house attraction, a feature the resort already experimented with when it opened a Stranger Things scare maze for day guests a couple of years ago and again when it opened some walk-through haunted houses in the fall of last year when it was clear that its annual Halloween Horror Nights event wasn't going to happen. New Article By Helen Coster Feb 2 (Reuters) - Rupert Murdoch's Fox News ended January with a 19-year streak as the top U.S. cable news network but ceded ground to CNN, according to Nielsen Media Research on Tuesday. But January marked a shift in both TV viewing habits and U.S. politics, as CNN viewers tuned in en masse as Democrats gained control of the U.S. Senate, former President Donald Trump's supporters stormed the Capitol and Democratic President Joe Biden was inaugurated. In the first full week following the Jan. 20 inauguration, however, Fox once again beat CNN and Comcast Corp-owned MSNBC in total primetime viewers. New Article Here are three terrific investments that can be pillars for your portfolio and you can build around for many years: Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ), Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), and Comcast (NASDAQ: CMCSA).

The device is currently limited to the cable giant's broadband subscribers that don't have traditional video service with Comcast, but management said it now has over 1 million active users on the platform, and that number is growing quickly.

The recent surge in Covid positive cases could prove to be an impediment in the path of Dish’s stock price growth. New Article Similarly, Comcast's (NASDAQ: CMCSA) Universal Studios theme park in California is closed, though its parks have reopened elsewhere, but new lockdowns would further widen the losses this segment is wreaking on their financial statements. Disney needs to bolster its streaming service because its theme parks are operating at less than optimal capacity, and Disneyland in California remains closed, even as the state's governor declared Hollywood studios essential businesses in his new lockdown orders.

A new bill under consideration in the state Assembly would allow larger theme parks and attractions to be treated the same way as their smaller rivals, and give them broader flexibility about getting back to business.

Mobile-device location data from analytics firm Placer.ai notes AMC's foot traffic over the holiday weekend was down 49% from 2019 and 46% from 2018, which is hopeful since the largest theater operator was able to recover over half of the moviegoers it lost to the pandemic.

Abrams and the DC Comics-inspired film “Batgirl,” and took $825 million in write-offs in its second quarter.

Below is a chart showing CMCSA's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $40.00 strike highlighted in red: Considering the fact that the $40.00 strike represents an approximate 2% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.
