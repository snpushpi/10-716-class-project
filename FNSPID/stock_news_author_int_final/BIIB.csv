Six percent of patients taking Tecfidera had lymphocyte counts less than about half of the normal level, so discontinuations because of lymphopenia could cut into revenue, but wouldn't be disastrous.

New Article Gilead Sciences has captured investors' attention this year thanks to wildly impressive sales of its hepatitis C drug Sovaldi, but the company is by no means the only fast-growing big biotech out there. Gilead's bottom line might jump in the coming year thanks to billions of dollars in expected sales for Harvoni, its next-generation hepatitis C drug, but three big-cap biotechs could grow profit even more quickly. The results were impressive, but speculators took shares lower after Biogen reported that an MS patient taking its fast-growing oral drug Tecfidera died after being diagnosed with PML, a rare brain disease. New Article During Biogen's third-quarterearnings conference call the company reported that one patient who took Tecfidera for four years died after being diagnosed with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, or PML, a rare viral disease that damages the material that protects white matter of the brain. Since PML isn't new to doctors treating patients with MS, existing treatment protocols will likely mean the risk to Tecfidera's market share is smaller than some may fear.

New Article What: Biogen (NASDAQ: BIIB) is down 12% at 1:15 p.m. EDT Tuesday after the biotech reported that opicinumab, one of its most lucrative pipeline drugs, failed a phase 2 clinical trial. No details were reported, but Biogen did note that there was ""evidence of a clinical effect with a complex, unexpected dose-response,"" which means the drug looked like it was working at one -- or potentially more -- of the four doses tested, but not the ones above or below it. A previous trial, called RENEW, in acute optic neuritis, which affects myelin in the eye nerves, showed that the time it takes for the signal to travel between the retina and the visual cortex in the back of the brain was faster in patients receiving opicinumab compared to placebo, but there wasn't an increase in the thickness of the optic nerve neurons and axons nor an increase in visual function.

It could have been worse though, and for Biogen Inc (NASDAQ: BIIB ), LendingClub Corp (NYSE: LC ) and Valeant Pharmaceuticals Intl Inc (NYSE: VRX ) shareholders, it was. Biogen Inc (BIIB) Hopes were high for Biogen MS drug opicinumab, but the company dashed those hopes today by reporting sub-par trial results, sending BIIB down a hefty 12.7% in the process. New Article 3: Biogen Inc.(NASDAQ: BIIB) Biogen racks up billions of dollars in sales every year from medicine that delays the progression of multiple sclerosis, but a moon-shot new drug that could have changed patient treatment forever has flamed out and shares have fallen sharply this week. Because ASCO's annual get-together can put small-cap biotech stocks on the map, investors were excited to learn earlier this year that Immunomedics' therapy for triple-negative breast cancer, sacituzumab govitecan, was selected for an oral presentation. This one-two punch significantly dented the company's share price, but investors may find a silver lining in the fact that ASCO's decision wasn't based on sacituzumab's efficacy in breast cancer. New Article Even though the indexes stayed relatively close to unchanged, several stocks posted big declines, and some of the worst performers included Biogen (NASDAQ: BIIB) , LendingClub (NYSE: LC) , and Valeant Pharmaceuticals (NYSE: VRX) . Biogen had hoped that opicinumab would produce confirmed improvement of neurophysical or cognitive function or disability over the time frame of the study, which covered 72 weeks. However, it revealed that its second-largest shareholder had sold off its stock in LendingClub, and it also warned that loan volume for its standard lending program would likely fall about 5% as a result of its attempts to limit exposure to riskier borrowers. New Article Meanwhile, top losers in the sector included Valeant Pharmaceuticals Intl Inc (NYSE: VRX ), down 21 percent, and Biogen Inc (NASDAQ: BIIB ), down 11 percent. Equities Trading UP China Auto Logistics Inc (NASDAQ: CALI ) shares shot up 172 percent to $2.86 after the company reported that it has sold Zhonghe to Wuxi Huitong Automobile Sales and Service Co., Ltd.

In early trading on Tuesday, shares of Western Digital ( WDC ) topped the list of the day's best performing components of the S&P 500 index, trading up 3.4%. New Article Now, there are questions among investors about whether this rally is sustainable - exacerbated by today's huge drop-off in IBB amid a double-digit hammering of Biogen Inc ( BIIB ) and Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ( ALXN ), which make up a combined 12% of the Nasdaq biotech ETF. You probably already know that the depressed nature of biotech stocks has a lot to do with politics; for instance, presidential aspirant Hillary Clinton threatening to rein in drug prices if elected into office.

New Article BIIB Revenue (Quarterly) data by YCharts Since Biogen's sales and profit are growing and it remains a giant in multiple sclerosis treatment, I think long-minded investors might be better off thinking of today's disappointing news as an opportunity to buy a top-tier biotech on sale. After all, today's drop means that investors can pay less than 13 times next year's EPS estimates to buy shares, and that could be a bargain.

And nowhere is this more evident than in large-capitalization biotech stocks Celgene Corporation ( CELG ), Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc ( REGN ) and Biogen Inc ( BIIB ).

However, with the valuations of these big names so low (AMGN's price-to-earnings ratio is 12.2, well below that of the sector and the S&P 500 ), I believe the weakness is actually an opportunity - one that current and probably short-term Brexit-based losses are exacerbating.

On the other hand and for the still-in-control bears, a decent price run off AGN's May low and into fairly significant layers of technical resistance from roughly $250 - $275, presents an opportunity to short Allergan shares and fade the current counter-trend rally.

New Article On Thursday, Biogen (NASDAQ: BIIB) announced it is shuttering its high-profile, late-stage aducanumab study. The study's primary endpoint was the demonstration of improvement in cognitive and functional impairment based on the Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) score compared to a placebo. Historically, 99% of the Alzheimer's disease drugs that have entered human clinical studies have ended up in laboratory dustbins rather than on pharmacy shelves.

New Article What happened Shares of biotech heavyweight Biogen (NASDAQ: BIIB) are in a tailspin this morning after the company and its partner Eisai (NASDAQOTH: ESALF) reported that they would discontinue two late-stage trials for Alzheimer's disease drug candidate aducanumab. Biogen and Eisai noted in the press release that their decision is based on the recommendation of an independent data-monitoring committee following a futility analysis. The biotech's core multiple sclerosis franchise is in decline , and its top growth driver -- Spinraza -- could face some stiff competition from a rival gene therapy soon. New Article Two questions spring to mind: How can that happen, and, more importantly for traders and investors, is it a reason for existing shareholders to bail and/or does it make BIIB a buy at these levels? That is just what happened this morning with Biogen (BIIB). When the news hit, BIIB lost over twenty five percent in a heartbeat. New Article Wise drug developers say only fools rush in, but Biogen (NASDAQ: BIIB) couldn't help falling in love with early data for experimental Alzheimer's drug aducanumab about four years ago. Even though Biogen raised the drug's list price, sales in the region fell 1%, to $3.3 billion, as pharmacy benefit managers demanded larger rebates to keep it in accessible formulary tiers. Novartis spent $8.7 billion last year to acquire a single-administration gene therapy, Zolgensma, and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will probably announce an approval decision in April. New Article Biogen Inc (NASDAQ: BIIB) was down, falling around 29 percent to $227.27 after the company said it will discontinue an ongoing Alzheimer's drug study. Shares of Sorrento Therapeutics Inc (NASDAQ: SRNE) shot up 23 percent to $4.30 after the company presented at Oppenheimer's healthcare conference in New York on Wednesday.

(NYSE: GES) shares dropped 14 percent to $18.89 after the company reported worse-than-expected Q4 EPS results. New Article Biogen (NASDAQ: BIIB) and its partner, Japanese drugmaker Eisai , announced that they would halt two late-stage clinical studies evaluating aducanumab in treating Alzheimer's disease. Another MS treatment, BIIB098, could win FDA approval by late 2019, but it could also cannibalize sales of Tecfidera. The stunning setback for the biotech's most promising pipeline candidate left investors with a key question: What's next for Biogen after its Alzheimer's disease drug flop? New Article In trading on Thursday, shares of Biogen Inc (Symbol: BIIB) entered into oversold territory, hitting an RSI reading of 17.7, after changing hands as low as $226.61 per share.

Shares of Biogen surged about 26% on Tuesday after the drugmaker announced plans to pursue regulatory approval for aducanumab, an investigational treatment for early Alzheimer's disease. New Article Millions of Alzheimer's disease patients, their families, and their friends felt their hearts sink when Biogen (NASDAQ: BIIB) broke the bad news that an experimental Alzheimer's therapy, aducanumab, had failed a pivotal study.

And so with BIIB crossing above that average target price of $253.95/share, investors in BIIB have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $253.95 just one stop on the way to an even higher target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table?",290.6722106933594

With more than 2.1 million Americans already infected, over 116,000 dead, and rising case counts in a large percentage of U.S. states, I believe Gilead can still profit by supplying remdesivir -- thus far one of the two only proven effective COVID-19 treatments.

The ruling comes months after the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled that a bioequivalent version of Tecfidera made by Banner Life Sciences LLC does not infringe a Biogen patent that was set to expire in June.

By C Nivedita and Medha Singh July 8 (Reuters) - U.S stocks were slightly higher in choppy trading on Wednesday, supported by technology shares as early signs of an economic rebound offset concern about further lockdowns due to a jump in coronavirus cases across the country. Investors have been weighing a string of upbeat economic data including record job additions and a rebound in the service sector in June, against the surge in U.S. coronavirus cases recently, but the S&P 500 is still up about 40% from its March closing low. New Article However, Biogen (NASDAQ: BIIB) posted gains today based on hopes for treating a different disease. Even as other major market benchmarks struggled to stay in positive territory, the Nasdaq flirted with its record levels, climbing 1% as of 3 p.m. EDT. Biogen has asked the FDA to give the application priority review status in the hopes of becoming the first company to produce a therapy that can slow the health decline caused by Alzheimer's. New Article Biogen (NASDAQ: BIIB) has finally submitted a biologics license application (BLA) for aducanumab, a monthly infusion that prevents amyloid plaques from forming in the brain. The first new drug application for an experimental therapy meant to prevent Alzheimer's disease from worsening finally reached regulators on Wednesday. Biogen ran a pair of pivotal studies with aducanumab, only one of which measured a significant benefit with regard to patients' dementia ratings after treatment with the highest dose tested. New Article What happened Shares of Biogen (NASDAQ: BIIB) were jumping 4.3% higher as of 3:42 p.m. EDT on Wednesday after rising as much as 9.9% earlier in the day. The gain came after the biotech announced that it had completed the submission of a biologics license application (BLA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for aducanumab as a treatment for Alzheimer's disease. However, hopes were dashed last year after Biogen halted two late-stage studies of aducanumab after an independent data-monitoring committee determined that the experimental drug was unlikely to be effective. New Article And the worst performing S&P 500 component thus far on the day is Mosaic, trading down 3.3%. Mosaic is lower by about 42.5% looking at the year to date performance.

The drug faces increasing competition from newer treatments, including Roche Holding AG's ROG.S Ocrevus, and Biogen in June lost a patent dispute with Mylan NV MYL.O over Tecfidera.

Last October, the company shocked many Alzheimer’s experts by reversing course, saying that a new analysis showed aducanumab could help patients with early-stage disease preserve their ability to function independently for longer. “They have been trying to lower the bar and help any company to get a drug approved,” said Dr. Marwan Sabbagh, from the Cleveland Clinic Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health in Las Vegas.

New Article Adds shares, FDA staff comment Nov 4 (Reuters) - Biogen Inc's BIIB.O experimental Alzheimer's disease drug was found effective enough in a large trial to support approval, U.S. Food and Drug Administration staff said on Wednesday, potentially making it the first drug to be approved in decades to slow down the progress of the memory robbing disease. The FDA staff's comments that come ahead of a meeting of a panel of independent advisers to the health regulator on Friday sent shares of the company soaring 30%. Biogen said it changed plans after a new analysis of the two studies showed a high dose of the drug could slow the disease's progression.

It's finally time for the Food and Drug Administration's committee of outside experts to decide on aducanumab, Biogen's (NASDAQ: BIIB) controversial drug for Alzheimer's disease. The opinion is split The FDA's summary concludes that Study 302 -- the positive one at the high dose -- is ""robust and exceptionally persuasive on several of the instruments used to evaluate efficacy."" New Article In recent trading, shares of Biogen Inc (Symbol: BIIB) have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $291.21, changing hands for $355.63/share. But the whole reason to look at the average BIIB price target in the first place is to tap into a ""wisdom of crowds"" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with BIIB crossing above that average target price of $291.21/share, investors in BIIB have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $291.21 just one stop on the way to an even higher target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table?

The agency is expected to make its decision by March, with aducanumab poised to become the first new treatment for the disease in decades and the first that appears to be able to slow progression of the fatal, mind-wasting condition, should it win U.S. approval. Alzheimer's disease is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States and there is ""a profound and enormous unmet medical need"" for new treatments, Billy Dunn, director of neurology products for the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said during the meeting. New Article After a long day of the Food and Drug Administration and Biogen (NASDAQ: BIIB) arguing that Biogen's Alzheimer's disease drug, aducanumab, should be approved, the FDA's committee of outside experts pushed back and voted strongly against the drug. After a closer look at the data, Biogen concluded that the higher dose of the drug was helping patients, and the leadership at the FDA seemed convinced as well. The third question asked about the drug's pharmacodynamics, which basically means whether aducanumab was doing what it was supposed to do: remove amyloid beta plaques from patient's brains. New Article By Deena Beasley and Manojna Maddipatla Nov 6 (Reuters) - Most outside advisers to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration voted ""no"" to whether a successful trial of Biogen Inc's BIIB.O experimental Alzheimer's drug can be viewed as evidence that it is effective without regard for a second, failed study. The data from the successful trial - detailed by Biogen and the FDA at the meeting - ""doesn't add up to strong evidence,"" said committee member Dr. Aaron Kesselheim, associate professor at Harvard Medical School. Alzheimer's disease is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States and there is ""a profound and enormous unmet medical need"" for new treatments, Billy Dunn, director of neurology products for the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said during the meeting.

Alzheimer's disease is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States and there is ""a profound and enormous unmet medical need"" for new treatments, Billy Dunn, director of neurology products for the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said during the meeting.

New Article Biogen Inc. (NASDAQ:BIIB) came out with its annual results last week, and we wanted to see how the business is performing and what industry forecasters think of the company following this report. NasdaqGS:BIIB Earnings and Revenue Growth February 5th 2021 Taking into account the latest results, the 28 analysts covering Biogen provided consensus estimates of US$11.1b revenue in 2021, which would reflect a not inconsiderable 18% decline on its sales over the past 12 months. These estimates imply that sales are expected to slow, with a forecast revenue decline of 18%, a significant reduction from annual growth of 6.2% over the last five years. New Article Biogen’s (BIIB) CEO, Michel Vounatsos said, “In 2020 Biogen executed well and maintained leadership across our core businesses in multiple sclerosis (MS), spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), and biosimilars, while simultaneously making significant progress towards building a multi-franchise portfolio through both internal pipeline developments and multiple new strategic collaborations.” The company also provided financial guidance for FY21. It also foreshadows just how dismal things could get if key upcoming regulatory and pipeline events don’t go their way.” Furthermore, Kasimov said, “That said, there is a lot of optionality in this story with the aducanumab Alzheimer’s PDUFA [prescription drug user fee act] obviously at the forefront… 1H21 is clearly setting up to be a make-or-break period for BIIB.” The rest of the Street is in line with Kasimov’s outlook with a Hold consensus rating. (See Biogen stock analysis on TipRanks ) “Although we expect a financial reset in 2021 primarily due to the entry of TECFIDERA generics, we believe that 2021 has the potential to be a transformative year for our pipeline with an anticipated regulatory decision in the U.S. on aducanumab for Alzheimer’s disease in June as well as pivotal trial readouts in postpartum depression, major depressive disorder, ALS [Lou Gehrig’s disease], and choroideremia,” Vounatsos added. New Article Recently, Biogen (NASDAQ: BIIB) became another casualty in the beta-amyloid battle, after a panel of experts at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) overwhelmingly voted that its experimental drug, aducanumab, did not establish efficacy in a pivotal phase 3 clinical study.

New Article By Mark Marex, Product Development Senior Specialist The Nasdaq Biotechnology Index (NBI) was launched on November 1, 1993, when the industry was still in the midst of the original “biotech revolution” ushered in by the discovery of recombinant DNA technology and Genentech’s IPO in 1980. McKinsey Global Institute estimates that up to 60% of the world’s physical inputs could be made using biological means, while up to 45% of the world’s disease burden could be addressed, leading to $2-4T of annual direct economic potential globally by 2030-40.2 In practical terms, this means for example, shifting some meat and plant production from traditional, resource-intensive agricultural methods to lab-grown, while increasing yields in the former thanks to precision mapping of a plant or soil’s microbiome and subsequent genetic engineering; repurposing fermentation (and other existing, natural processes) to create sustainable, biodegradable (and in some cases, even self-repairing) fabrics; truly personalized medicine and nutrition plans stemming from increasingly cost-effective human genomics and direct-to-consumer testing; leveraging biofuels to more efficiently store energy while initiating biosequestration processes to capture carbon emissions; even using DNA to store near-limitless quantities of data. Summary While the Coronavirus pandemic continues to pose significant risks to both the macroeconomic and physical health of the entire planet, the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index offers a unique lens through which to view human society’s scientific and technological advancements in fighting the virus.

Biogen tied up with Sage in a deal worth over $1.5 billion plus milestone payments in November to co-develop drugs for depression and other neurological disorders. New Article Biogen (NASDAQ: BIIB) investors got some great news last week when the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the company's Alzheimer's drug, Aduhelm. Back in November, shares of Biogen skyrocketed when the FDA called the company's drug trials ""highly persuasive"" and hinted that approval may be inevitable given its effectiveness. While analysts have been cheering, setting price targets as high as $500 for Biogen, those rosy outlooks could change quickly if another trial doesn't put critics' fears to rest. New Article In corporate news, Biogen Inc BIIB.O fell 0.9% in premarket trading after the drugmaker's potential therapy for choroideremia, an inherited disease that leads to vision loss, did not meet the main goal in a late-stage study. By Shashank Nayar June 15 (Reuters) - Futures tied to the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq held near record highs on Tuesday as investors looked for comments from the Federal Reserve about whether a recent jump in inflation would prompt a sooner-than-expected tapering in monetary policy. The Fed is likely to announce in August or September a strategy for reducing its massive bond buying program, but won't start cutting monthly purchases until early next year, a Reuters poll of economists found. New Article Sage Therapeutics (SAGE) and Biogen (BIIB) said their phase 3 study of zuranolone in patients with major depressive disorder has met its primary endpoint. The Health Care SPDR (XLV) was advancing by 0.13% and the iShares NASDAQ Biotechnology Index (IBB) was declining 0.07%.

By Shashank Nayar and Medha Singh June 15 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks eased on Tuesday after the S&P 500 hit a record high earlier in the session, as a strong inflation reading for May raised caution that the Federal Reserve could taper monetary stimulus sooner than expected. Assurance from the Fed that rising prices are transitory and falling U.S. Treasury yields have helped ease some concerns over inflation and supported U.S. stocks in recent weeks, with all eyes now on the central bank's statement at the end of its two-day policy meeting on Wednesday. New Article So what Today, Sage Therapeutics announced top-line results from the Waterfall study with zuranolone, a potential new drug for major depressive disorder that the company is developing in partnership with Biogen (NASDAQ: BIIB). Finally, results from the Waterfall study suggest zuranolone isn't capable of reliably providing long-term benefits. Today's results for zuranolone suggest its chances of earning accelerated approval from the Food and Drug Administration are slim. New Article Biogen (NASDAQ: BIIB) stock has been on fire for the past month with a stunning gain of 46%, adding over $20 billion to its market cap.

(SAGE) and Biogen Inc. (BIIB), a pioneer in neuroscience, together announced positive results for the Zuranolone drug, which is being evaluated for the treatment of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). Following the announcement, Oppenheimer analyst Jay Olson reiterated a Buy rating on the stock with a price target of $100, implying 70.1% upside potential to current levels. Olson said, “We believe these results support the rapid-acting profile of Zuranolone as a differentiated approach to episodic MDD, which remains a large unmet need… We suspect market reaction reflects misconceptions about relative importance of rapid onset vs. durability, providing an attractive entry point for SAGE.” The rest of the Street is cautiously optimistic about the stock with a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 8 Buys versus 9 Holds. New Article Now that the Food and Drug Administration has approved Biogen's (NASDAQ: BIIB) Aduhelm despite its mixed results, it theoretically made it much easier for new treatments to get the green light. Despite its phase 2 study only being set up to detect biomarkers (secondary indicators of possible improvement), preliminary data is showing gains in primary function. In four previous animal models studied for memory and learning, the drug led to a full recovery in mice with AD, stroke, Down syndrome, and traumatic brain injury. New Article It would be no exaggeration to say last week’s FDA decision to approve Aduhelm - Biogen’s (BIIB) treatment for Alzheimer’s - is a landmark result in the fight against the memory-obliterating disease. The leading neurologist oversees 1,000+ Alzheimer's patients at his South U.S. center and has taken part in 30-40 trials including BIIB's EMERGE study and Roche’s trials. 30-40% of patients will 'drop out' due to PET radiopharmacy ordering failures (10-15%), ARIA safety, dosing inconvenience, and noncompliance (skipping dose).” All in all, Yee rates BIIB shares a Buy and his $500 price target implies ~28% upside from current levels.

New Article Adds details from release, background Oct 20 (Reuters) - Biogen Inc BIIB.O fell well short of Wall Street estimates for third-quarter sales of its Alzheimer's drug Aduhelm on Wednesday, as the drugmaker struggles to sell the treatment to hospitals and get insurers to cover it. Biogen has pinned its hopes on Aduhelm, the first new treatment for the memory-robbing disease in nearly 20 years, as it wrestles with increased competition for its main revenue drivers. Several commercial insurers are waiting for further direction from the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) before covering the drug, while some large hospitals have declined to use it. New Article With that in mind, let's look at two quality companies that will help your portfolio shine over the next decade: Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ: ISRG) and Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY). That's not to mention the time it takes to train medical staff on the machine, and the instruments and accessories healthcare facilities have to purchase to perform various procedures with it. That's not to mention Eli Lilly's non-diabetes drugs, including cancer medicine Verzenio and Alimta, and immunosuppressant Taltz, all of which are performing splendidly. New Article Then there is the citizen petition that New York-based law firm Labaton Sucharow filed with the FDA requesting that the agency halt clinical trials featuring Simufilam. Add these to the other headwinds that Cassava Sciences could run into, including the very real possibility that Simufilam will fail miserably in its phase 3 clinical trials or that it will encounter regulatory setbacks, and this biotech stock looks far too risky to invest in, even at current levels. But even though that good news out of India will have no notable impact on Ocugen's business, its stock price jumped anyway, topping the $10 mark for the first time in months. New Article However, Biogen Inc BIIB.Oshares closed down 0.6% as it reported a much smaller-than-expected quarterly sales of its Alzheimer's drug while it raised its full year earnings forecast.

New Article By Deena Beasley and Julie Steenhuysen Sept 27 (Reuters) - An experimental Alzheimer's drug developed by Eisai Co Ltd 4523.T and Biogen Inc BIIB.O significantly slowed cognitive and functional decline in a large trial of patients in the early stages of the disease, the companies said on Tuesday. Eisai said the results from the 1,800-patient trial prove the longstanding theory that removal of sticky deposits of a protein called amyloid beta from the brains of people with early Alzheimer's can delay advance of the debilitating disease. The so-called amyloid hypothesis has been challenged by some scientists, particularly after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's controversial approval of Aduhelm in 2021 based on its plaque-clearing ability rather than proof that it helped slow cognitive decline.

New Article By Deena Beasley SAN FRANCISCO, Nov 29 (Reuters) - An experimental Alzheimer's disease drug from Eisai 4523.T and Biogen BIIB.O slowed cognitive decline in a closely-watched trial but may carry a risk of dangerous side effects for certain patients, according to new data presented on Tuesday. The companies said in September that the 18-month trial, which enrolled nearly 1,800 participants with early-stage Alzheimer's, found that treatment with lecanemab reduced the rate of decline on a clinical dementia scale (CDR-SB) by 27% compared to a placebo. Eisai believes the trial results prove a longstanding theory that removal of sticky deposits of a protein called amyloid beta from the brains of people with early Alzheimer's can delay advance of the debilitating disease.",268.4778137207031

Biogen said it was expecting commercialization expenses for Leqembi, the Alzheimer's disease drug developed jointly with Eisai Co Ltd 4523.T, to exceed revenue from the treatment in 2023. The company has been counting on Leqembi to help overcome a series of setbacks from its older Alzheimer's drug Aduhelm, as new Chief Executive Officer Christopher Viehbacher tries to jumpstart growth. New Article By Manas Mishra Feb 15 (Reuters) - Biogen Inc BIIB.O said on Wednesday that Alzheimer's disease drug Leqembi would bring in modest revenue for the year although it might not be enough to offset costs tied to its launch.

The company expects full U.S. approval for Leqembi by summer or late this year, and possibly broader insurance coverage by the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services thereafter.
