And while equities were drifting lower from the open, selling pressure rapidly accelerated after Draghi pointed the finger at the lack of structural reforms for Europe's economic woes, magnifying jitters over a possible recession across most of the continent.

PepsiCo's third-quarter results were very good. In addition, PepsiCo raised its full-year forecast after providing third-quarter earnings. New Article Volatile economies in Latin America could be detrimental to the overall results for the company, as this operating unit typically forms close to 30% of the net volumes, with Mexico being the largest consumer of Coca-Cola's offerings in the world.

PepsiCo's response before this test to follow Coca-Cola into home carbonation was a springtime deal with Malta's Bevyz, but that multidimensional maker of hot and cold beverages has yet to hit the U.S. market.

What happened Shares of Monster Beverage (NASDAQ: MNST) traded 6% lower at noon, EDT, as soda-and-snacks giant PepsiCo (NASDAQ: PEP) announced a $3.85 billion acquisition in the energy drink sector. New Article (RTTNews) - Responding to PepsiCo To Acquire Rockstar statement, A.G. BARR plc (BAG.L) said Wednesday that it retains the exclusive distribution rights for the Rockstar brand in the UK, Ireland and certain European territories. Earlier today, PepsiCo Inc. (PEP) said it agreed to acquire energy drink maker Rockstar Energy Beverages for $3.85 billion. PepsiCo has been a distribution partner for Rockstar in North America since 2009. New Article PepsiCo said the proposed transaction should close by mid-year and is not expected to result in a material increase in its FY20 net sales or per-share earnings. Among consumer stocks moving on news: (-) PepsiCo (PEP) fell 3.3% on Wednesday after the snacks and beverage giant announced a $3.85 billion deal to acquire Rockstar Energy Beverages in a bid to capture a larger share of the ""functional"" drinks segment.

New Article (RTTNews) - PepsiCo, Inc. (PEP) has agreed to acquire Rockstar Energy Beverages, which produces beverages designed for those who lead active lifestyles from athletes to rock stars. PepsiCo does not expect the acquisition to be material to its revenue or earnings per share in 2020.

New Article The deal seems like a natural pairing as PepsiCo has distributed Rockstar products in the North American market since 2009, and the beverage giant has been angling to be a bigger player in energy drinks. With soda sales slipping and the energy drink market still expanding at an impressive clip, the move makes a lot of sense for PepsiCo -- and the Rockstar brand could benefit from having the beverage leader's resources behind it.

Sept 24 (Reuters) - B&G Foods Inc BGS.N said on Thursday it would drop an image of a Black chef from the packaging of its Cream of Wheat porridge mix, the latest company to make branding changes widely considered as racially insensitive. New Article The first action related to this was the removal of more than 1,600 assistant store managers from the company's Costa coffee shops in the U.K. Rival PepsiCo (NASDAQ: PEP), on the other hand, had a much better second quarter, with sales declining just 3%, mostly due to its more diversified product portfolio, which includes snacks and breakfast options. The major share of that decline came from Coca-Cola's large on-the-go segment due to theater closures and people staying home.Â However, this company generally delivers strong quarterly growth despite its leading-player status.

New Article May 10 (Reuters) - Several U.S. companies, including PepsiCo, Qualcomm and Cummins, struck a cautious note on their growth prospects in China, blaming what they said was a slower-than-expected recovery after the country lifted COVID curbs in December. ""China is getting better, but slowly,"" PepsiCo PEP.O Chief Financial Officer Hugh Johnston told Reuters late last month. In April, China's imports contracted sharply, underscoring signs of weak domestic demand as a battered property market, worries over job stability and global economic uncertainty kept shoppers wary. New Article PepsiCo (PEP) Source: FotograFFF / Shutterstock PepsiCo (NYSE:PEP) has been one of the leading dividend stocks for steady income for several decades now. I like PepsiCo not just because the company has raised its annual payout for 51 consecutive years, but because it has a very strong brand. Whether that’s orange juice, Pepsi, or Cheetos, the firm has its hands all over the food and beverage world. New Article The company signed a distribution deal with PepsiCo in late 2022 that's leading to a robust increase in points of distribution. It seems its partnership with Pepsi is taking the Celsius brand to the next level. To me, this points to a still-large international opportunity that Pepsi can help Celsius capture. New Article We’re only in early May, but already some solid dividend-paying stocks such as Home Depot (NYSE:HD), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) have increased their dividend payouts.

New Article The performance stands out against larger brands like PepsiCo's snack foods, which reported a double-digit increase in sales last quarter. Coca-Cola and PepsiCo have experienced declining volumes in certain categories.

These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs. New Article These wins have helped push shares back near all-time highs, setting Coke's stock apart from peers like PepsiCo (NASDAQ: PEP). And while PepsiCo grew its beverage business at roughly the same pace, Coke's profit margins are more than double Pepsi's. Coke shares are trading for over six times annual sales, compared to a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 3 for PepsiCo and of 3.7 for packaged-foods specialist McCormick. New Article Another stock in the Consumer Staples sector, PepsiCo (PEP), has outperformed the sector so far this year.

New Article Companies like Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) and Pepsi (NYSE:PEP) have been able to pass on higher prices to willing consumers, leading to booming top- and bottom-line results. The Fed is simply pushing on with its campaign to reduce inflation unsuccessfully, while simultaneously increasing risk in the banking sector. It seems strange to me personally, as I’ve grown tired of paying $5 for a bag of chips, but I guess I clearly don’t represent the average consumer. New Article Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if PEP shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for PepsiCo Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.

The $92.2 million in revenue is down 15.8% compared to last year but beat the Marketbeat.com consensus by 50 basis points on strength in international markets. The excellent news is that the adjusted EBITDA loss narrowed by nearly 50%, and additional improvement is expected by the end of the fiscal year. New Article The most encouraging aspect of Celsius' recent financial results is that its integration with Pepsi’s distribution network is still ongoing. In August 2022, Pepsi took a $550 million stake in Celsius which has undoubtedly given Celsius more clout in retail. As Celsius continues to add distribution points through its Pepsi relationship, shelf space and sales should keep growing.
