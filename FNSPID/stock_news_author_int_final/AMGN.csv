Despite these repeated comments of both Amgen and Cytokinetics, my last report caused some confusion and alarm among readers because it seems axiomatic in biotechnology investing that missing the primary endpoint of a late stage trial is a major setback that will pummel the stock price.

Revenues, as per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, currently stand toward the lower end of the company's guidance at $20.9 billion. New Article The pipeline could offer plenty of shareholder-friendly news flow in the coming years, but even if some of these drugs stumble, investors can at least rest easy knowing that Celgene's balance sheet is among the best in its industry. That dividend increase and the company's plans to return 60% of its adjusted net income to investors through 2018 may mean that Amgen is an arguably better buy than those big pharma peers, which have seen their sales drop due to patent expiration. Sales could get additional support this year from Blincyto, an immunotherapy that was approved in December to treat a specific population of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia patients, and from evolocumab, a next generation bad-cholesterol busting drug that analysts think could have multi-billion blockbuster potential, too. New Article In Amgen's Tuesday presentation, investors were made privy to what the company's CEO Bob Bradway believes are the key events that everyone should be focused on in 2015. Amgen boosted its dividend by 30% last year and very well could put more money in income investors' pockets if its handful of regulatory submissions work in its favor.

A key benefit of the deal is that it will help to diversify Abbvie's revenue base away from its reliance on their blockbuster drug Humira, which is set to lose patent protection in the U.S. in December 2016 and in the EU in 2018. Here's why: Looking ahead, analysts see AbbVie continuing to grow its bottom line over the next five years by more than 14%, which makes the company's forward price-to-earnings multiple of 14 look quite reasonable.

New Article Despite the year being only half over at this point, we've already seen dozens of high profile mergers, several closely-watched experimental drugs report pivotal top-line data, and a number of major developments on the regulatory front. The twist, though, was that the agency recommended that both drugs be approved for a far smaller patient population than originally intended -- at least until ongoing cardiovascular outcomes trials lend support to the hypothesis that they do indeed lower the risk of heart attacks and strokes. Earlier this year, Express Script's Dr. Miller, for instance, took direct aim at the host of costly new cancer medicines coming on the market, proposing a plan that would reimburse companies based on the effectiveness of their drugs.

Repatha represents the first of a new class of cholesterol lowering medicines called PCSK9 inhibitors to receive approval anywhere in the word, and the drug could offer huge revenue potential for Amgen. If PCSK9 inhibitors can live up to the hope that they promise to the millions of patients around the world who struggle to control their cholesterol levels, then investors in both companies should be poised to profit in the years ahead.

Biotech ETFs languished late last week after Biogen Inc (NASDAQ: BIIB ) pared 2015 after it reported disappointing results for an experimental drug to treat Alzheimer's disease. One day does not make a trend, but Monday's bullish performances for bearish biotech ETFs could be a warning sign for an industry group that comprises 10.5 percent of the S&P 500's weight. New Article Healthcare giants Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and Sanofi SA (ADR) treated their investors to great news over the weekend as the companies announced that they won FDA approval of their highly anticipated cholesterol-lowering medication Praluent. However, now that Praluent has officially cleared U.S. regulatory hurdles and appears to have a good chance to doing the same in Europe, I understand why the market is so excited about the company's near term future. With a lot of good news priced into the stock, I'm personally going to keep Regeneron on my watch list for now, but would be more than happy to add it to my portfolio if current sales projections for Praluent prove to be too conservative, or it the market as a whole were to take a fall . New Article Specifically, investors are going to want to pay attention to the give-and-take between Amgen's mature products, which are seeing slowing or declining growth prospects and its newly approved therapies that are being expected to pick up the slack. For instance, Amgen's mature products, such as Neulasta/Neupogen, a white blood cell enhancer for chemotherapy patients, and Enbrel, an arthritis drug, are at that point in the cycle where they've plateaued. In order to support its generous shareholder perks, including a 2% dividend yield (which has grown mighty fast over the past three years) and copious share buybacks, Amgen decided the best course of action was to trim the fat in the workplace, so to speak.

Revenues of Amgen's other ESA, Epogen, declined 4% to $491 million, reflecting a shift in dialysis customer purchases to Aranesp as well as the impact of competition. New Article These savings will go toward boosting its gross margin in the long run over the 50% mark, while helping to offset the rising costs related to its robust phase 3 pipeline and its multiple upcoming drug launches. It's worth noting, that Amgen received an approval from the Food and Drug Administration expanding its label on Kyprolis to a second-line status for multiple myeloma patients just last week. If my arm were twisted and I were forced to choose I would probably side with optimists here as Amgen's cost-cutting efforts and ability to raise prices on its therapies should help it at least maintain its EPS for the intermediate future.

New Article Shares of the original biotech blue-chip stock Amgen rocketed higher by 15% in July, according to data from S&P Capital IQ , following three major catalysts.

New Article We also have to wonder whether or not physicians will be scared of not being reimbursed for the high cost of PCSK9 inhibitors, causing a slower-than-expected launch of this next-generation class of drugs. If the study demonstrates that Repatha's LDL-cholesterol reducing effect actually leads to fewer cardiovascular deaths or heart attacks, then power for pricing will probably shift entirely into Amgen's corner. The article Amgen's Next-Generation Cholesterol Drug Is Approved, but Pricing Is a Huge Concern originally appeared on Fool.com. New Article Reported clinical results demonstrate the power of these new medicines; in phase 3 trials, patients who used Repatha were able to reduce their LDL cholesterol by approximately 54%-77% when compared with using a placebo, which is an enormous improvement. While I sincerely doubt PCSK9 inhibitors will ever come remotely close to the $100 billion annual cost mark, you can bet Express Scripts and the pharmacy benefit manager segment of CVS Health will be fighting tooth and nail to control spending on this new class of drugs. Given the market potential for Repatha and the company's capital return program , this biotech blue chip now sports a dividend yield near 2%, which is definitely making this investor think it might be time to add a few shares to his portfolio.

Similar, but less expensive In 2011, the two companies teamed up to develop four biosimilars that could eventually capture billions of dollars in market share away from top-selling biologic medicines, including Avastin, which is manufactured by Roche Holdings . Looking ahead Because 68% of all newly diagnosed cases of NSCLC occur in patients over 65 and 10,000 baby boomers turn 65 daily, the number of people likely to require treatment for this cancer is likely to grow, rather than shrink, over the next 10 years.

Eli Lilly and CompanyLLY is set to report third quarter 2015 earnings results on Oct 22 before the market opens. New Article In 2006, after plowing $800 million into the development of a CETP inhibitor that could solidify market share when its top-selling Lipitor lost patent protection in 2011, Pfizer was forced to shelve the drug when late-stage studies found that it actually increased, rather than reduced, the risk of death, heart attack, or stroke. Evacetrapib's failure also casts doubt on other potential competitors to Regeneron and Amgen, including Merck 's anacetrapib, a CETP inhibitor that's being evaluated in a 30,000 patient study that began in 2011 and that is expected to wrap up in 2017. Looking ahead There's no question that heart disease patients need new treatment options and it's a shame that so much money and time has been invested in CETP inhibitors that could have been focused on other areas of research, but trial and error is nothing new in drug development and just because evacetrapib came out on the losing end of its study doesn't necessarily mean that Eli Lilly shares should be sold .",201.01873779296875

We'll start by assessing these companies' potential for growth in the near term, as well as the health of their balance sheets, in case a so-called ""black swan"" decides to pay a visit to biotech next year. After all, it's quite telling that Regeneron, the only company expected to generate double-digit growth next year -- and that lacks a serious debt problem to boot -- is projected to do so based in large part on the launch of its new cholesterol-lowering drug Praluent.

In the midstage COSMIC-HF trial, which Amgen and Cytokinetics reported results from a little more than a month ago, omecamtiv mecarbil ""showed statistically significant improvements in several measures of cardiac function, including systolic ejection time, stroke volume, and N-terminal-pro-brain natriuretic peptide, at 20 weeks following randomization"" in chronic heart failure patients.

New Article Amgen ( AMGN ) pays a 2.4% dividend. P harmaceuticals aren't just a source of relief for physical ailments -- their oft-steady dividends can provide some comfort even if their stocks underperform. The New York-based drug giant plans to redomicile in Ireland, and it announced last month that it's acquiringAllergan ( AGN ) for $160 billion. New Article The approval should more than double Amgen's potential patient pool and will be critical in helping Kyprolis make a run at blockbuster status ($1 billion in annual sales). Amgen took the smart road for the time being, which was to get its foot in the door for genetic high cholesterol diseases and establish safety, efficacy, and a rapport with physicians and patients. The move was designed to help offset the rising costs of manufacturing and marketing new drugs, but it could eventually lead to operating margins in excess of 50% toward the end of the decade. New Article Currently, more than half ofAmgen 's ( AMGN ) sales come from drugs that debuted in the 1990s: the sister drugs Neulasta and Neupogen, both of which stimulate production of white blood cells, and Enbrel, which treats immunology conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis. In a Dec. 14 note upgrading Amgen to overweight, Morgan Stanley analyst Matthew Harrison estimated that outcomes data could add 20% in annual sales of Repatha, even if Praluent (as is likely) gets the same result. Amgen won approval for somewhat less advanced multiple myeloma this summer, and it produced studies demonstrating a survival benefit, as well as Kyprolis' effectiveness without Velcade. New Article This is always a risk and worry for investors in drugmakers, but Amgen is taking a page from rivals and developing its own lineup of biosimilars to drugs from peers. It also maintains its dividend-paying lead over Gilead Sciences , a similarly sized peer (in terms of market capitalization) in the biotech orbit. In addition, Amgen has a longer history of sharing the wealth with stockholders; Gilead Sciences only initiated its distribution this past April.",198.01556396484375

The reason for Aegerion's exceedingly rough year is that the company's flagship drug Juxtapid, indicated for genetically based high cholesterol, is facing stiff competition from the newly approved PCSK9-inhibitors from Amgen and Regeneron . Personally, I'm siding with the rest of Wall Street on this issue, and think Juxtapid's sales will start to slide in a big way as Amgen and Regeneron's respective drugs gain acceptance among clinicians and patients alike.

New Article In addition to more than a half-dozen ongoing studies with Revlimid that could further expand its label, the drug continues to amass substantial market share and maintain strong pricing power in its given indications as a first- and second-line treatment for multiple myeloma. Growth doesn't appear to be an issue at the moment or in the intermediate future, but patent exclusivity periods are finite, and Celgene will eventually need to deal with the introduction of generic competitors. In my opinion the answer to this question is yes -- not only because of its collaborations and Receptos acquisition, which could diversify its product portfolio, but because of its ability to expand its label indications for Revlimid and really stagger its exclusivity losses over many years.

Any upside above $180 would be lost if the stock rises there and is called away, but AMGN shares would have to climb 16.2% from current levels for that to occur, meaning that in the scenario where the stock is called, the shareholder has earned a 22.4% return from this trading level, in addition to any dividends collected before the stock was called.",190.39767456054688

New Article In August 2015, after the end-of-phase 2 meeting with the FDA, management said lowering low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) -- that's the bad kind -- would be good enough for approval: By the time the meeting notes arrived a month later, the tone had changed, and management hedged on the possibility that it might actually need an outcomes trial for approval: And then yesterday, Esperion Therapeutics' management threw up their hands and said the FDA has no idea whether cholesterol lowering will be enough when the company completes its trial in 2019: Now what: The FDA's view on LDL-C lowering might change because Amgen 's(NASDAQ: AMGN) Repatha and Praluent, sold by Sanofi (NYSE: SNY) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: REGN) , are scheduled to release cardiovascular outcome studies in the coming years. What: Esperion Therapeutics (NASDAQ: ESPR) is down about 40% at 12:20 p.m. EDT after updating investors on the pathway to approval for its cholesterol-lowering drug bempedoic acid, which used to go by the moniker ETC-1002.

AMGN had reported net income of $2.08 billion during the same time of last year. New Article What happened Amgen (NASDAQ: AMGN) , the original biotech blue-chip company, reported its third-quarter earnings results after the closing bell on Thursday, handily surpassing Wall Street's consensus figures and raising its full-year guidance. Multiple myeloma drug Kyprolis was the standout with year-over-year growth of 34%, likely a result of its label expansion into second-line treatment, while sales of Neupogen plunged 36% to just $183 million. Now what Today's double-digit move lower is a bit surprising, because I personally didn't think anyone on Wall Street believed 20% to 30% annual price hikes on Enbrel were sustainable over the long run.

Enbrel delivered revenues of $1.45 billion, flat with the year-ago quarter, as higher net selling price was offset partially by volume decline due to increased competition and unfavorable changes in the inventory level. New Article Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ: AMGN) reported its third-quarter results after the market closed on Thursday. Bradway agreed that healthcare costs need to be addressed but stressed that people ""shouldn't lose sight of the fact that it's the economic and societal burden of disease that is the enemy."" Sean Harper, executive vice president of research and development, also stressed that the company is committed to advancing the drug as a first-line treatment for multiple myeloma. New Article Yet even before that news sent the market lower, Amgen (NASDAQ: AMGN) , McKesson (NYSE: MCK) , and StoneMor Partners (NYSE: STON) were falling substantially. Friday's session closed the week on a down note for the stock market, with early gains being erased after a renewed FBI investigation of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton made investors more anxious about the uncertain fate of the 2016 elections. Amgen will have to make pricing concessions in order to ward off potentially even worse impacts from generic competition, and as a result, some investors fear that the biotech giant will struggle to find ways to replace lost revenue and earnings in the long run.

New Article Pfizer has exclusive rights to Amgen Inc.'s AMGN blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis (RA) drug Enbrel outside the U.S. and Canada Prevnar revenues declined in the U.S. due to the ""high initial capture rate"" of the eligible adult patient population following Prevnar-13's successful 2014 launch, which resulted in a smaller remaining ""catch up"" opportunity in the third quarter compared to the year-ago quarter.

New Article Below is a chart showing AMGN's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $185 strike highlighted in red: The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the January 2019 covered call at the $185 strike gives good reward for the risk of having given away the upside beyond $185. Shareholders of Amgen Inc (Symbol: AMGN) looking to boost their income beyond the stock's 2.8% annualized dividend yield can sell the January 2019 covered call at the $185 strike and collect the premium based on the $5.80 bid, which annualizes to an additional 1.9% rate of return against the current stock price (at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost ), for a total of 4.7% annualized rate in the scenario where the stock is not called away. Any upside above $185 would be lost if the stock rises there and is called away, but AMGN shares would have to climb 29% from current levels for that to occur, meaning that in the scenario where the stock is called, the shareholder has earned a 33% return from this trading level, in addition to any dividends collected before the stock was called.

New Article Here's why Amgen (NASDAQ: AMGN) , Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ: GILD) , and Jazz Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: JAZZ) may be deeply undervalued right now.

For example, the recent AMGN share price of $174.59 represents a price-to-book ratio of 3.9 and an annual dividend yield of 2.6% - by comparison, the average dividend paying stock in the Nasdaq 100 yields 2.1% and trades at a price-to-book ratio of 6.7. New Article In my experience, if investors get what they expected (plus a lift in guidance) and the stock doesn't rally, then it's a bad sign. The good news is that their average price target is almost $40 and that plays perfectly into the technical upside potential I noted.

It will also help diversify the index by removing overlap between companies of similar scope and adding new types of businesses that better reflect the U.S.economy. Thousand Oaks, California-based Amgen is a biotechnology company, while Honeywell International, headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina, is a technology conglomerate.

Instead of averaging out the 30 underlying stock prices directly, the index uses a special divisor as the denominator in order to maintain continuity. One of the only meaningful implications is that all index funds that track the Dow Jones Industrial Average will now need to rebalance their portfolios accordingly, which creates short-term buying pressure for the new additions and selling activity for the removed stocks. New Article In are software provider salesforce.com (NYSE: CRM), manufacturing company Honeywell (NYSE: HON), and biotech favorite Amgen (NASDAQ: AMGN). They'll reduce its exposure to energy and traditional pharmaceuticals in favor of tech and biotech, and will substitute the much-changed Raytheon with a former Dow component in Honeywell. That makes their exit less impactful than it would have been if S&P Dow Jones Indices had chosen higher-priced representatives of their respective industries. New Article Since the market continues to value technology more and energy less, Salesforce's replacement of Exxon was meant to offset Apple's reduced influence.

Digital data: The new commodity that moves the economy Nicholas Rossolillo (Salesforce): At first glance, ExxonMobil being supplanted by a tech firm is a head scratcher. However, even before the COVID-19 pandemic and ensuing lockdown started rendering large swathes of the economy redundant, the digital world was growing fast and was supplanting less profitable legacy business operations.

By Mark Marex, Product Development Senior Specialist The Nasdaq Biotechnology Index (NBI) was launched on November 1, 1993, when the industry was still in the midst of the original âbiotech revolutionâ ushered in by the discovery of recombinant DNA technology and Genentechâs IPO in 1980.

New Article Let's consider two such stocks that you can buy for less than the relatively modest sum of $500: Amgen (NASDAQ: AMGN) and Merck (NYSE: MRK). The key to earning great returns over long periods is to invest -- even modest sums -- regularly in excellent stocks and hold those shares for a while. Amgen has been dealing with declining sales for some key products, including immunosuppressant Enbrel and neutropenia medicine Neulasta, for some time now due to competition (biosimilar and otherwise) and other factors. New Article With a small army of Wall Street analysts predicting on average that AbbVie's (NYSE: ABBV) revenue will shrink in 2023 as well as in 2024, investors are right to be cautious, and perhaps even a bit skittish. And if the already gloomy estimates of management and Wall Street end up being rosier than what happens in reality over the next few quarters, it's hard to imagine the stock experiencing anything other than an all-out rout. With approvals for additional indications likely on the way, the company expects to bring in more than $21 billion in annual revenue from the combination of the pair by 2027 when their sales scale up to reach their peak, topping its largest haul from Humira.
