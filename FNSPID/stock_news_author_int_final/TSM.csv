New Article Look at who else has large margins... To my knowledge, the majority of MediaTek's processors are manufactured by Taiwan Semiconductor , or TSMC. It doesn't design processors for sale to end customers; TSMC works with companies like MediaTek to enable them to develop competitive chip designs, and then it actually builds the chips. This means that TSMC is able to generate approximately 50% gross margin on a wafer that it sells to MediaTek, and then when MediaTek actually sells the chips from that wafer, it too collects approximately 50% gross profit margins. New Article Although TSMC won this round, there has been much speculation that Apple would be moving back to its longtime frenemy, Samsung, for the manufacture of the A9/A9X chips that will presumably power next year's iDevices. Samsung now has everything to gain; TSMC now vulnerable Taiwan Semiconductor's financial results have been quite good, with the company reporting very robust year-over-year growth. Hidden in plain sight A quick search on LinkedIn for ""Apple 14nm"" reveals the following profile of a former Apple engineer who claims to have worked on designing both ""14nm"" and ""16nm"" SRAMs, presumably to be used in next-generation A-series processors: This profile strongly suggests that Apple spent the effort developing chips for both TSMC's 16nm manufacturing technology and Samsung's 14nm technology.

Intel would presumably get $1.7 billion in annual foundry revenue at approximately a 50% gross profit margin, but it would have to cough up $264 million per year in licensing payments.",53.95615768432617

Don't confuse gross margin percentage with overall profitability Generally speaking, a customer that is willing to buy in bulk can get a per-unit discount. The idea is that if a customer can guarantee large orders, the vendor is willing to take a per-unit discount for the sake of adding significantly to both revenue and raw gross profit.

One variant of the A9 is manufactured in TSMC's 16-nanometer FinFET Plus manufacturing process while the other is built in a Samsung 14-nanometer process (a reliable source tells me that Samsung is likely using its more advanced 14-nanometer LPP process, rather than its lower-performing LPE process, here).",32.16047286987305

New Article If TSMC can get 7-nanometer into high volume manufacturing by the first quarter of 2018, a year after ""risk production"" is slated to begin, then I suspect that this will be more attractive to Apple than Intel's 10-nanometer technology for the iPhone that launches in the fall of 2018. A10 is already decided, and it's not Intel Inside; Intel 10nm too late for A11 Although Arcuri's speculation with respect to Apple's potential plans for the A10 seem sensible, it was recently reported in the Commercial Times that TSMC has won the entirety of the Apple A10 orders -- something that I believe to be accurate .

However, given TSMC's public statements, it's reasonable to expect that the 2017 A11 chip will benefit from a transition to a 10-nanometer process and that the 2018 A12 chip will benefit, once again, from a transition to a 7-nanometer manufacturing technology.

New Article Even today, less than a quarter of TSMC's revenue comes from shipments of chips on its 16-nanometer and 20-nanometer technologies combined. This means even if TSMC is taking it on the chin with respect to the margins on those technologies (and TSMC has indicated that it takes a while for its latest technologies to achieve margins in line with the corporate average), the remaining 77% of its revenue can more than buoy overall gross profit margins. In some of its product segments, rapid adoption of newer manufacturing technology isn't imperative, but in others, it's absolutely critical. New Article The bottom line is, TSMC would need to have its 7-nanometer manufacturing technology cranking out production chips in the May-June timeframe for Apple to reasonably be able to hit its launch goals. However, I do expect that the A11X, which will probably power the new iPads that are likely to emerge in the spring of 2018, to be built on TSMC's 7-nanometer technology -- paving the way to a 7-nanometer A12 chip for the iPhone 9 later that year. According to an article published in the Wei Feng network, Apple 's(NASDAQ: AAPL) next-generation smartphone processor, which is likely to be marketed as the A11 Fusion, will be manufactured in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company 's(NYSE: TSM) 7-nanometer chip-manufacturing technology.

In terms of pure chip profitability, TSMC wins hands down, something that's becoming plainer as Qualcomm's highly lucrative licensing business comes under pressure.

Below is a chart showing TSM's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $70.00 strike highlighted in red: Considering the fact that the $70.00 strike represents an approximate 8% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. Investors in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., Ltd. (Symbol: TSM) saw new options begin trading today, for the September 18th expiration. New Article However, compared to a year ago, 5G mobile network expansion and data center construction to support cloud computing services is creating a dramatic upside for TSM. The world's largest chip manufacturing outfit, Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE: TSM), is perhaps the best proof yet of this. The surging HPC unit, which includes both 5G and data center hardware manufacturing, more than offset contractions in smartphone chips (47% of revenue), Internet of Things (8%), and automotive (4%).

Fresh off the launch of M1 Macs -- a momentous occasion that has been in the works for nearly a decade -- Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) may be turning its silicon ambitions to Project Titan, the company's oft-rumored autonomous car initiative that has stagnated in recent years and faced numerous setbacks. New Article NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) is flying high right now, riding a new hardware upgrade cycle driven by its graphics processing units (GPUs) for high-end video games and data centers in need of a computing update. These are still high-value semiconductors, but big tech is demonstrating it can pull of a coup of sorts against traditional chip makers and designers, and illustrates the challenge these modern marvels of manufacturing face on the road ahead. But as for hardware specifically, the bet on ARM signals NVIDIA's future shift toward licensing of technology -- a far more stable business model than the traditionally cyclical nature of semiconductor industry sales driven by upgrade cycles.",56.00228500366211

This is basically a valuation call because TSM has a valuation I think it was 30 the last time I checked it. New Article The company has reportedly been paying large sums to foundry giant Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, popularly known as TSMC, to ensure that it has enough 5-nanometer wafers to make its upcoming cards. According to third-party estimates, Nvidia reportedly paid $1.6 billion to TSMC in the third quarter of 2021 to secure wafer supply, a figure that could increase to $1.8 billion in the current quarter. In all, it is expected to pay nearly $7 billion to TSMC to secure wafers for the RTX 40 series cards. New Article Firms such as TSMC 2330.TWTSM.N are major suppliers to Apple Inc AAPL.O and other global tech giants, as well as providers of chips for auto companies and lower-end consumer electronics. The ministry attributed the February growth to strong demand for electronic components as well as chips, coupled with the easing of some material shortages and the effect of delayed shipments. Many companies expect global chip shortages to last at least for the rest of the year, which will continue to fill Taiwanese semiconductor firms' order books.",81.47064971923828

New Article Chipmaking giant Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) just reported its second-quarter 2022 results, and it went a long way toward assuaging fears that the chip industry is headed for a sharp downturn. The takeaway here is that TSM is still firing on all cylinders, and the global economy's hunger for technology's basic building blocks isn't abating anytime soon. On the contrary, TSM grew at a healthy clip during the spring quarter. New Article The stable expansion of its 5nm and 7nm nodes kept TSMC comfortably ahead of its two largest rivals, Samsung and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), in the race to produce smaller and denser chips. Intel, which has fallen far behind TSMC and Samsung in that race over the past decade, completely abandoned nanometer-based measurements under CEO Pat Gelsinger -- who took the helm in early 2021 and tried to overhaul the chipmaker's manufacturing operations.

Taiwan is a major producer of chips used in everything from cars and smartphones to data centres and fighter jets, and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC) TSM.N is the world's largest contract chipmaker and Asia's most valuable listed firm. New Article Conclusion The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about TSMC. TSMC (TSM) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. During this period, the Zacks Semiconductor - Circuit Foundry industry, which TSMC falls in, has lost 18.2%.",52.62187194824219

Those problems caused Intel to lose ground to AMD -- which outsourced the production of its CPUs to TSMC -- in the desktop and notebook markets. Instead of becoming a fabless chipmaker like AMD, Intel doubled down on upgrading its plants to catch up to TSMC by 2025. New Article But when that cyclical downturn finally ends, AMD could be better positioned for a quick comeback than Intel, which continues to pour tens of billions of dollars into technological upgrades to catch up to TSMC. AMD generates a higher operating margin than Intel (even though it sells cheaper chips and has a lower gross margin) because it outsources its manufacturing to third-party contract chipmakers like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM). AMD's decision to outsource its production to TSMC also enabled it to pull ahead of Intel in the ""process race"" to manufacture smaller and denser chips -- and that technological leap has driven its market-share gains against Intel over the past few years.

At a 14 P/E ratio, it remains a cheaper chip stock than Apple and trades near levels where Buffett's company bought TSMC shares. How Berkshire's Apple investment increased Berkshire's 13F filing following third-quarter 2022 earnings revealed a surprising purchase -- 60 million shares of Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE: TSM). New Article Meanwhile, Stephen Mandel of Lone Pine Capital added to his stake in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), which ranks as his sixth-largest holding. TSMC: The largest contract chip manufacturer Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC) is the world's largest semiconductor foundry, meaning it manufactures chips designed by other companies. TSMC works with a number of clients at the forefront of their respective industries, including Amazon, Apple, Nvidia, and Qualcomm. New Article Many investors were surprised to find a large position in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) on Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B) latest disclosure of its portfolio holdings. But the size of the investment has led many to believe Buffett himself is responsible for building a stake in TSMC. TSMC's gross profit margin is substantially higher than those of other stand-alone semiconductor foundries like GlobalFoundries or United Microelectronics. New Article But Berkshire's 13F filing just came out for the third quarter and shows that Buffett and his team initiated a large position in one tech stock: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM). TSMC is a crucial part of the semiconductor industry because it makes some of the world's smallest and most advanced chips, which gives it a significant moat and impressive gross margins of 55%. Its products serve a comprehensive range of attractive end-markets including mobile devices, high-performance computing, automotive, Internet of Things (IoT), and more. New Article With that, Wendell Huang, VP and Chief Financial Officer of TSMC commented, “Our third quarter business was supported by strong demand for our industry-leading 5nm technologies Moving into fourth quarter 2022, we expect our business to be flattish, as the end market demand weakens, and customers’ ongoing inventory adjustment is balanced by continued ramp-up for our industry-leading 5nm technologies.” TSM Stock Price Aside from that, as of today, TSMC has a PE Ratio of 13.91.

New Article ASML's monopolization of that crucial technology -- which is used by top foundries like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), Samsung, and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) -- makes it a linchpin and bellwether of the semiconductor industry. That's because TSMC, Samsung, and Intel still need to continuously invest in smaller and denser chips to avoid falling behind the tech curve. But that reputation is a double-edged sword: Persistent concerns regarding the deceleration of sales in the PC, smartphone, and cloud markets all caused ASML's stock to decline more than 30% from its all-time high of $870.85 a share last September. New Article It is worth noting that TSMC is on track to deliver this impressive growth in 2022 despite pockets of weakness in certain semiconductor niches such as smartphones and personal computers. The robust demand for chips used in the Internet of Things, vehicles, and data centers, plus TSMC's relationship with Apple -- which has defied the smartphone slowdown -- are the reasons it has been putting up solid numbers.

(TSM): Free Stock Analysis Report Investors now see warmer ties between the world’s two largest economies after the G20 (Group of Twenty) summit, reducing delisting risks for hundreds of New York-listed Chinese firms and boosting the outlook for trade. New Article Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company: 1.4% The newest addition and biggest buy during the third quarter for Warren Buffett's company is semiconductor stock Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE: TSM), or TSMC. But the important connection here is that TSMC is the sole supplier of the silicon processors Apple uses in all of its products. With CEO Tim Cook spearheading a multiyear transition that'll see his company focus on high-margin subscription services and Apple repurchasing a whopping $554 billion worth of its common stock over the past decade, all the appropriate boxes have been checked for the Oracle of Omaha. New Article While the Oracle of Omaha had lots of good reasons to invest in TSMC, there might actually be a greater opportunity in Taiwan Semi's key suppliers, like these three profitable semiconductor equipment stocks. Warren Buffett turned heads last week when he invested in a semiconductor stock for the first time, foundry giant Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM). With a foundry-focus and a resilient high-margin services business, Applied Materials is a solid cash generator at a cheap valuation, like TSMC. New Article Warren Buffett made headlines when his company, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B), recently revealed a more-than-$4 billion stake in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (NYSE: TSM). The company is apparently actively buying equipment in preparation for this project, in addition to other initiatives to boost its locally sourced materials and recycled waste. However, it's going to require tens of billions of dollars for all of these capital-intensive projects, and it's still unclear how much funding from the U.S. CHIPS Act will be used in support of Taiwan Semi's expansion efforts. New Article The build-out in the U.S. is no doubt a good risk mitigator for the company, as tensions between China and Taiwan boiled over this summer, leading some to fear a potential Chinese invasion, which would disrupt TSM's production of crucial semiconductors. While TSM's stock could decline in the short term in those scenarios, over time, semiconductor sales will grow, likely faster than overall GDP, thanks to increased digitization and other powerful long-term growth drivers.

TSMC seems to be both a wonderful company and available at a wonderful price. Apple, Buffett's largest holding, is TSMC's largest customer and the chipmaker is considered such an important supplier that it is building a foundry in Arizona to serve Apple further. New Article What happened Shares of foundry giant and new Warren Buffett holding Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation (NYSE: TSM) were rising today, up as much as 4% before settling in to an above-market 2.8% gain as of 2:38 p.m. EST. It's possible the cumulative knowledge TSMC has gained by serving a diverse set of third-party chip design customers played a part in its technological success, so Gelsinger's new strategy makes sense. There wasn't much company-specific news today; however, a key executive departure at rival Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) may indicate Intel's ambitious plans to catch up with TSMC in leading-edge production may have hit a setback. New Article Shares of world’s largest contract chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor TSM surged after it was revealed that Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway invested more than $5 billion in the company. TSMC accounts for around 55% of the global foundry or fab market. TSMC, NVIDIA and ASML are its top holdings. New Article Taiwan Semiconductor Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE: TSM) is a newcomer to the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio, and since semiconductors are not one of the industries that Buffett knows best, this is likely another purchase by his carefully handpicked lieutenants. Note that it's not necessarily Buffett himself who has decided to buy them, as he has two investing lieutenants, Ted Weschler and Todd Combs, who also call many shots. Not only does it have the dominant e-commerce destination, it has other valuable assets, such as its Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud computing business. New Article In its latest disclosure, we learned that Berkshire Hathaway bought more than $4.1 billion worth of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) shares in the third quarter. At recent prices, TSMC's American depository receipts, which are essentially shares of a foreign business that trade on U.S. exchanges, offer a 2.1% dividend yield.

Due to the ongoing rise in rates and worries over an economic slowdown likely to result in slumping consumer spending, investors have been speculating that TSM’s performance could suffer a strong blow over the short-to-medium term. With its growth remaining impressive, risks of a Chinese invasion likely being overblown, and shares still trading at an inexpensive valuation, it's easy to see why TSM makes for a fitting holding in Berkshire's portfolio.

The Oracle of Omaha revealed a $4.1 billion stake in TSMC recently, and it's not surprising to see why the foundry giant has made its way into Berkshire's portfolio. TSMC's 43% slide in 2022 means it's available at an attractive valuation.

New Article So what TSMC is today benefiting from a report by Taiwan's DigiTimes that says the company will begin to scale its production of industry-leading 3 nanometer semiconductor chips as early as mid-2023. But viewed in light of the expected timeline for TSMC's introduction of its newest chips (i.e., mid-2023), it would appear that investors are looking at six months of lean times for semiconductor stocks -- followed, possibly, by a return to growth in the second half of the new year. What happened All's well that ends well in the stock market -- and as trading winds down in what has been a miserable year for semiconductor investors, shareholders of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), and Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM) are getting a reprieve of sorts.

New Article So what Over the last year, the semiconductor industry has been reeling from weak consumer PC sales, but TSM was reporting robust growth through the third quarter, partly thanks to healthy demand for advanced 5-nanometer wafers. In that case, the lack of clarity on TSM's growth trajectory makes it more difficult to accurately assess the company's intrinsic value, which might have led to the sale. What happened Shares of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) (TSM) were down 2.3%, compared to a 1.2% drop for the S&P 500 index, shortly after the market opened on Thursday. New Article Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if TSM shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., Ltd., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing TSM's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $95.00 strike highlighted in red: Considering the fact that the $95.00 strike represents an approximate 4% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.

Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.B) initiated a sizeable stake in the semiconductor giant last year, only to ditch 86% of its stake just a few months later.

And so with TSM crossing above that average target price of $89.33/share, investors in TSM have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $89.33 just one stop on the way to an even higher target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table? But the whole reason to look at the average TSM price target in the first place is to tap into a ""wisdom of crowds"" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes.

Additionally, Intel, Samsung, and even TSMC have moved to bring more manufacturing to other parts of the world, which probably means more demand for ASML's machines. Moreover, while TSMC's growth will probably recover, the boom in foundry production makes the threat of an invasion a tailwind for ASML, even if an attack never happens. New Article One of the most important companies in the world -- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), aka TSMC -- reported its first-quarter earnings last week. As of this writing, TSMC is trading down almost 10% in the past month. TSMC's guidance for the rest of the year is not optimistic, either. New Article TSMC said it will continue to spend plenty of money on chipmaking equipment this year (at least $32 billion worth, to be exact), even as it works through lower chip manufacturing demand. Reports from top customer Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) underscores the certainty of ASML's growth forecast. The company's capacity to get photolithography equipment -- the tools used to make the finest of microscopic features on silicon wafers, which eventually get cut into advanced chips -- was constrained last year. New Article According to industry association SEMI, there's a downturn in revenue brewing for these businesses in 2023 as chip manufacturers manage their spend on equipment (a primary driver of that capex for TSMC). Rather, I believe it gave the green light to buy chip equipment stocks like Applied Materials for this year and beyond, as TSMC will be highly reliant on those suppliers for its future success.

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) is the overwhelming leader in the semiconductor foundry industry, and that's not going to change anytime soon. New Article In this video, I will discuss some recent AI updates investors should know about after some recent earnings from companies like Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), ASML Holdings (NASDAQ: ASML), and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM). Find out why Tesla is one of the 10 best stocks to buy now Our analyst team has spent more than a decade beating the market. Jose Najarro has positions in Advanced Micro Devices, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia, Qualcomm, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, and Tesla. New Article Demand concerns intensified after Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSM), the main chipmaker for Apple and Nvidia, cut its annual outlook and projected a 10% fall in sales, versus previous guidance for a single-digit decline. With the stock priced at about 29 times forward earnings, ASML Holding is more expensive than peers such as Applied Materials (AMAT) and KLA Corp (KLAC). However, economic uncertainty remains high, with the global chip industry currently grappling with the impact of inflation and recession fears that triggered a pullback in consumer and business spending last year. New Article In particular, second-quarter revenue fell 6.2% sequentially or 13.7% year-over-year to $15.7 billion, with global economic conditions dampening end-market demand, which led to an unfavorable inventory adjustment by TSM's customers. Such wild swings in profitability highlight TSM's highly-cyclical business model, serving as a reminder that this year's seemingly unfavorable results are typical market reactions and should not overly concern investors.

(Symbol: TSM) is up about 2.5%, Qualcomm Inc (Symbol: QCOM) is up about 0.8%, and ASML Holding NV (Symbol: ASML) is up by about 1%. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

New Article The three that I think will cross this threshold are Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE: TSM), and Mastercard (NYSE: MA). Even though the legacy automakers are starting to launch their own EVs, there is little to suggest Tesla is in any danger of losing its leadership position in the U.S. Moving on to a slightly more aggressive pick, Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC) is the world's top semiconductor foundry. Because it is a contract factory, companies like Apple and Nvidia have TSMC make their chips, which gives the chips a uniquely neutral position in the marketplace. New Article A bullish investor could look at TSM's 29.6 RSI reading today as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., Ltd. (Symbol: TSM) presently has an excellent rank, in the top 25% of the coverage universe, which suggests it is among the top most ""interesting"" ideas that merit further research by investors.

Below is a chart showing TSM's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $90.00 strike highlighted in red: Considering the fact that the $90.00 strike represents an approximate 4% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.

Advanced packaging has been a current bottleneck in getting AI chip systems out to customers, so the fact that TSMC is now increasing orders to potentially double its packaging output by next year indicates that AI chip demand is increasing, not waning.

New Article I feel companies like TSMC (NYSE:TSM) and ASML (NASDAQ:ASML) offer much better value now as the foremost suppliers of key semiconductor manufacturing tools and technologies. Competitive Pressures Are Real In other words, believing Nvidia will maintain total dominance over the AI chip space indefinitely is not prudent, in my opinion.

New Article China's alternatives to EUV systems The chip sanctions against China also barred Chinese chipmakers from outsourcing the production of their high-end chips to the world's most advanced chip foundries -- TSMC (NYSE: TSM), Samsung, and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) -- which use ASML's EUV systems to manufacture their smallest, densest, and most power-efficient chips. But it accomplished that by pushing older DUV systems to their limits (as TSMC also did before it switched to EUV systems), which resulted in a much less cost-efficient method of producing 7nm chips. SMIC is now attempting to crack the 5nm barrier, which only TSMC and Samsung have done so far using ASML's EUV systems.
