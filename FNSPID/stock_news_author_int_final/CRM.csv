CRM’s integration services solution, MuleSoft, helps its customers unify, unlock, and secure their data and this offering was included in five of Salesforce’s top 10 deals. The report also says that a key trend in this industry is the rising demand for the deployment of CRM suites and solutions through the software-as-a-service (SaaS) model.

In simple terms, CRM software is used by consumer-facing businesses to access and enter real-time customer/client information. Just how dominant is Salesforce in the CRM space? New Article Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) posted a strong set of results for Q1 FY’22, with revenue rising 23% year-over-year to $5.96 billion. Salesforce.com Stock Comparison With Peers summarizes how CRM compares against peers on metrics that matter. See Our Complete Analysis For Salesforce.com While we think Salesforce.com stock looks slightly undervalued, it is helpful to know how its peers stack up. New Article This momentum continued in Q1 2021 as the company beat consensus estimates by posting revenue of $108.5 billion, up 44% y-o-y and earnings were recorded at $16.09 per share compared to $5.09 in the same period of the previous year. While the company is likely to continue to report strong revenue growth over the foreseeable future, and the increasing contribution of its high-margin Amazon Web Services (AWS) business should also have a positive impact on the profit margin, we think the current P/E multiple figure of nearly 140x is already too high – making further gains to the stock price very unlikely. The stock price has been on a run as Amazon benefited from millions of people in the U.S. and abroad turning to online marketplaces to fulfill their essential requirements like groceries, food, toiletries, and medicines. New Article While the expansion of 5G and IoT is likely to drive demand for the wireless networking business, competition is also strong, with rival Ericsson making more headway compared to Nokia in recent years. Although Nokia’s Networking segment has lower margins compared to its Licensing operations, it is the primary driver of the company’s sales. If the business fares better than expected, it could help Nokia’s stock, which has largely missed out on the big tech rally.",199.97918701171875

New Article By Andrew Chung WASHINGTON, April 17 (Reuters) - U.S. Supreme Court justices on Monday weighed a bid by Salesforce Inc's CRM.N Slack Technologies to avoid a lawsuit over its 2019 direct listing in a case that could undermine the ability of shareholders to sue companies for alleged misstatements when they go public. The justices heard arguments in an appeal by Slack, which makes workplace communications software, of a lower court ruling that let the proposed class action lawsuit filed by shareholder Fiyyaz Pirani for alleged violations of a federal investor protection law proceed. Circuit Court of Appeals in 2021 rejected Slack's bid to dismiss the case because Pirani cannot prove his shares were registered, saying the argument in the context of a direct listing would ""create a loophole large enough to undermine the purpose of Section 11.""

New Article In recent trading, shares of Salesforce Inc (Symbol: CRM) have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $217.85, changing hands for $218.87/share.

Otherwise, wrote Judge David Hamilton in the majority opinion, a company like Salesforce could “simply bury its head in the sand with respect to individual victims” in order to evade responsibility for providing tailored services to the most “egregious” traffickers. “Nothing in the statutory text requires such an odd result.” Hamilton and Judge Doris Pryor also found that Salesforce is not shielded by Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which protects online publishers from claims based on third-party content.
