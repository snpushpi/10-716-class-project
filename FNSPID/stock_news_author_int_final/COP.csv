Yes, Chevron is unprofitable today In fact, S&P Global Market Intelligence data show that Chevron has incurred losses of $746 million over the past 12 months Then again, Shell and Conoco are unprofitable, too, reporting losses of $48 billion and $71 billion for the same period, respectively (and Exxon stock sells for a rich 35 times earnings, which tells us it's not very profitable, either) Those numbers alone tell you that Chevron is in better financial shape than some of its rivals today Meanwhile, Simmons insists that the key to investing profitably in the oil industry isn't to focus on a stock's profitability today, but on where the oil industry as a whole is in the oil cycle This, argues the analyst, tells you more about the profits that a company will earn in future years The most important thing: Where are we in the oil cycle? In the Journal 's estimation, and it seems in Simmons', too, oil prices of $50 to $70 look to mark the ""equilibrium"" point, and will be sustainable If correct, that means we could see a run-up in oil prices of anywhere from 16% to 63%, and perhaps as soon as later this year That's where we are in the cycle And if Simmons is right, that's how close we are to a big jump in Chevron stock as well A secret billion-dollar stock opportunity The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology And we think its stock price has nearly unlimited room to run for early in-the-know investors!",90.41878509521484

Yet the 6% rise to $0.265 per share on a quarterly basis represented just the tiniest of boosts compared to the magnitude of the previous year's cut, showing just how far the oil market has to go in order for ConocoPhillips to return to its past glory. The energy industry has been tough on oil and gas exploration and production companies for the past few years, but a recent rise in oil prices has finally started to help out big players like ConocoPhillips (NYSE: COP) .

In the charts above, we present our base case estimates for Chesapeake's natural gas output and price over the next 4 years. In other words, if the natural gas glut in the US persists for long, it could create a downside of around 30% for Chesapeake's valuation.

Many of its peers -- including ConocoPhillips -- were forced to slash their dividends as low oil prices cut into their cash flow. Couple that with some unscheduled downtime plus a dry hole in the North Sea in December, lower-than-expected quarterly volumes in Egypt, and the sale of the company's Canadian assets last year, and production is likely to be down.

Already, CAPEX spending in 2018 is set to rise , and while it is still less than estimated potential cash flows, the lucrative cushion that has allowed COP to do many of its amazing things for investors will be lower. The deal was only $400 million, and it is technically a bolt-on, but it could signal - along with COP's very bullish stance on raising production - that the firm may be getting a bit greedy. New Article That led Lance to answer the question on investors' minds: In other words, even though oil prices have risen, that's not going to cause ConocoPhillips to adjust its operating plan, since its strategy isn't to grow production but cash flow. ConocoPhillips (NYSE: COP) ended 2017 on a high note , delivering its best financial performance of the year.

The positive impact of higher price realization in 2017 was partially offset by lower production due to asset sales and natural field declines during the year, coupled with the company's effort to increase its liquids exposure. During the 4Q'17 earnings call, Anadarko emphasized that it would use its increased cash flows to enhance its shareholder value in the form of dividends and share buybacks, rather than chasing aggressive production growth. New Article Instead of reinvesting the cash produced at current prices, companies like Anadarko Petroleum (NYSE: APC) and ConocoPhillips (NYSE: COP) are using the excess money to reduce debt and ramp up cash returns to investors.

New Article As a percentage of COP's recent stock price of $60.43, this dividend works out to approximately 0.50%. In general, dividends are not always predictable; but looking at the history above can help in judging whether the most recent dividend from COP is likely to continue, and whether the current estimated yield of 2.02% on annualized basis is a reasonable expectation of annual yield going forward. The chart below shows the one year performance of COP shares, versus its 200 day moving average: Looking at the chart above, COP's low point in its 52 week range is $56.75 per share, with $80.24 as the 52 week high point — that compares with a last trade of $60.27.
