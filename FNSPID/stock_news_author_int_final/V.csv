New Article Card giants Visa ( V ) and MasterCard ( MA ) are scheduled to announce earnings for the quarter ending September on Wednesday, 31 st October, 2012. Although MasterCard announced earlier in an investor-community meeting that it expects revenue growth in the second half of the year to be lower than the 9% growth observed in the second quarter, we expect both companies to benefit from an increase in consumer spending in the U.S. Our price estimates of $135 for Visa and $451 for MasterCard are both in-line with the current market price. A WTO hearing earlier this year has ruled in favor of Visa and MasterCard stating that the Chinese government was violating its regulations by not allowing the two to expand their businesses. New Article The better-than-expected results were largely due to the outcome of better pricing, increased number of processed transactions, strong gross dollar value (GDV) growth and lower tax rate. MasterCard's effective tax rate for the reported quarter was 27.6%, quite lower than 30.5% in the year-ago period, primarily attributable to a benefit from deduction related to software and additional export incentives. MasterCard benefits from strong secular demand growth, meaningful international exposure, diversified product portfolio, high barriers, excellent pricing power, risk-free balance sheet and impressive operating leverage.

New Article Visa has demonstrated a tendency to see its earnings-driven extended-hours moves post sharp reversals in follow-on regular session trade, particularly on the downside - a factor that favors longs. Looking deeper into the performance data, Visa has recorded an earnings-driven after-hours decline in 15 quarters we've tracked, reversing direction the following day in nine of those events, or 60% of the time. With this decent level of consistency on the downside, longs should be watching any negative moves to gain insight into where potential floor supports could form.

New Article American Express (NYSE: AXP) has a long history of being a pioneer in the payment card business, and its membership model has given the company a cachet among high-income customers that its rivals lack. Moreover, American Express has aggressively sought new customers, and the danger is that a lack of underwriting diligence could lead to bringing on less-creditworthy cardholders that in turn could boost default rates in the future. However, litigation against American Express has been underway for years, in which the federal and various state governments allege that provisions limiting merchants from recommending other cards amount to impermissible antitrust violations. New Article Both prior announcements specifically mentioned the ability to instantly cash out funds via debit cards, so today's news shouldn't come as a surprise. P2P payments have taken off recently in part because users are increasingly splitting tabs at coffee shops, restaurants, and bars, which are small transactions; paying a $0.25 fee to instantly access the $3 that your friend just sent you hardly seems worth it, for example. Beyond heavyweights stepping in , there is a broader shift of messaging platforms integrating P2P payments, a trend that has become increasingly popular in Asia (most notably with WeChat in China). New Article Costco (NASDAQ: COST) took a major risk one year ago when the company dropped its longtime credit card partner American Express in favor of Visa provided by Citigroup . It risked consumers being unwilling to make the move, and there was the possibility that non-rewards card holding American Express users would choose to shop elsewhere.

New Article Visa (NYSE:) reported its quarterly earnings results late on Wednesday and it was a mixed bag in store for the credit card giant as its profit was stronger than what the Wall Street consensus estimate called for and its revenue grew year-over-year, yet it failed to beat expectations, playing a role in sending V stock declining after hours. Visa’s profit was stronger than the Wall Street guidance, as analysts who were polled by FactSet saw the business bringing in earnings of $1.24 per share. For its fiscal 2019, Visa reaffirmed its forecast, which includes annual net-revenue growth in the low single digits on a nominal basis. New Article This means that Visa takes only a small cut, in the low-single-digit percentage range, of every transaction made through its card. Visa is an enormous buyer of its own stock, a tendency I've criticized it for in the past (as I don't think it sufficiently benefits shareholders). Visa (NYSE: V) is an immense company with a commanding presence in nearly every corner of the world. New Article (RTTNews) - Visa Inc.

PayPal's founders Peter Thiel was a fledgling hedge fund manager with a law degree from Stanford and a diverse background that included stints as a speechwriter for former Secretary of Education William Bennett and a derivatives trader for Credit Suisse. As PayPal's former executive vice president, Reid Hoffman, aptly pointed out, not even in Silicon Valley, the technology capital of the world, did an entire random group of diners sharing a table at a restaurant all own Palm Pilots, effectively ending this experiment. New Article When Visa (NYSE: V) reported its 2019 first-quarter earnings three months ago, there were reasons for concern, most notably a significant slowdown in cross-border payment volume growth. While Visa couldn't comment on this during its conference call due to pending regulatory approval, it's notable that the company outbid rival Mastercard (NYSE: MA) this quarter to acquire Earthport, a business specializing in cross-border payments. Remitly is an international remittance company that digitally transfers more than $6 billion in annual volume across regions such as Africa, Asia, Central Europe, and South America. New Article This conflict turned in favor of non-cash in 2016, when the global amount of payments by card/digital means exceeded that of bills and coins for the first time, according to researcher Euromonitor. Not surprisingly, as the top brand in the world by cards outstanding, Visa has seen a pronounced upward trend in the number of transactions processed on its network over the past few years.

That helped put more money in the company's pocket as its satellite radio operation booked an 8% increase in revenue for the period. Spring has sprung, and the Growing Season can only mean one thing: Yes, Warren Buffett's investment vehicle Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK-A)(NYSE: BRK-B) will almost certainly record yet another bout of growth in the value of its stock portfolio. New Article This asset-light business model allows Mastercard and Visa to sport operating margins greater than 50% while the companies sit back and collect a steady stream of revenue as consumers make their purchases. This revenue segment accounts for a variety of services Mastercard can bundle and offer its financial institutional clients, including data analytics, loyalty program management, and fraud prevention tools. Physical forms of currency -- cash and personal checks -- are losing favor among global consumers to alternative forms of payment, including debit and credit cards, digital wallets, mobile commerce platforms, and, in some circles, even cryptocurrencies.

It's easy to understand why Visa wins in the war against cash: As more merchants seek digital payments and e-commerce grows, customers are inclined to use plastic money.

Below is a chart showing V's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $197.50 strike highlighted in red: Considering the fact that the $197.50 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.

Visa's higher top line could also hit a ceiling a bit sooner than Mastercard's might, which would impact the stock's potential long-term growth.

New Article Contributing to investors' election concerns are polls showing that Trump's standing among voters has eroded amid criticism over his handling of the coronavirus pandemic as well as the protests sparked by the killing of George Floyd in police custody. A Reuters/Ipsos poll released June 2 showed that Biden's lead over Trump, a Republican, among registered voters expanded to 10 percentage points - the biggest margin since the former vice president became his party's presumptive nominee in early April.

New Article Flippen: And to further add to the lumpiness that you can expect to see, when you talk about bad timing for Hasbro, they actually, earlier this year, at the end of 2019, early 2020, made an acquisition of a Canadian television production company, Entertainment One.

On a similar note, American Express’ revenue for the full year 2020 decreased by 17% y-o-y to $36.1 billion, primarily due to lower discount fees and a drop in net interest income. American Express’ revenues have grown roughly by 23% from 2016 to 2019, which translated into a similar growth in Net Income (earnings margin dropped in 2017 due to the enactment of the U.S Tax Act, before normalizing in the subsequent year).

New Article By Medha Singh and Vidya Ranganathan Jan 10 (Reuters) - A weak start to 2022 and a host of looming macro and technical headwinds are setting cryptocurrencies up for a rough ride in the weeks to come. Far from being the hedge against inflation or the uncorrelated alternative asset it was sometimes plugged as, bitcoin has suffered disproportionately, losing 40% from its peak in November, as the Federal Reserve and other major central banks spelt out plans to raise rates and remove monetary stimulus. Analysts Dalvir Mandara and Bilal Hafeez at research firm Macro Hive pointed to outflows from cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds and the reduced profitability of incoming bitcoin as reasons to be bearish. New Article What happened For the fourth day in a row, shares of credit card giant Visa (NYSE: V) continued to decline on Monday, hitting a 3% loss as of 1:20 p.m. During the pandemic, this trend got even better for Visa, as consumers eschewed cash in favor of plastic -- and indeed, were essentially forced to use credit and debit cards when quarantined and shopping from home. Long story short, that's why Mizuho is now more conservative about Visa's prospects today: It thinks the company used up a lot of its growth potential during the pandemic, and now has a smaller runway along which to grow in 2022.

Below is a chart showing V's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $225.00 strike highlighted in red: Considering the fact that the $225.00 strike represents an approximate 3% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.

V recently collaborated with the well-established U.S. blockchain technology company ConsenSys to build an infrastructure for ensuring seamless integration of central bank digital currency (CBDC) networks into traditional financial service providers. To explore the module's potential, the Global Crypto Advisory Practice and Digital Currency Innovation Hub teams of Visa have plans to commence working with central banks and financial institutions on pilot and prototype actual use cases from Spring 2022.

The larger potential concern, considering the rise in alternative forms of digital payment, is that Visa could lose some of its leverage with large retailers, and wind up compelled to further adjust its fee structure. Even with increasing competition amid a shifting landscape, it has the massive network, great brand, and financial strength to adapt, whether that involves forging connections to the cryptocurrency space or rolling out its own version of BNPL.

Mastercard also anticipates robust spending in the back-to-school season (July through September), with retail sales expected to be up 7.5% over last year and 18.3% compared to 2019. Mastercard has historically been able to navigate downturns well as it is part of a duopoly with Visa in the credit processing space, but these are unusual times, so keep a close eye on economic indicators. New Article So today, I'll take a closer look at three promising fintech stocks -- Adyen (OTC: ADYE.Y), MercadoLibre (NASDAQ: MELI), and Visa (NYSE: V) -- and explain why they could be better bets than most cryptocurrencies. The stock isn't cheap at 50 times this year's adjusted EBITDA, but its robust growth and disruptive potential -- which pulled eBay away from PayPal in 2018 -- justify that premium valuation. MercadoLibre's stock looks reasonably valued at 35 times this year's adjusted EBITDA -- and it could still have plenty of room to run as income levels and e-commerce penetration rates climb across Latin America.",143.23318481445312

New Article Since a changing earnings picture is a powerful factor influencing near-term stock price movements, the Zacks rating system is very useful for individual investors. They may find it difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, as these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time.

Bottled-up demand and the easing of COVID-19 curbs have led to the strongest summer travel season since the start of the pandemic, a boon for companies like Mastercard and Visa Inc V.N that can charge more for overseas transactions. While spending at card companies has stayed strong, worries that an economic slowdown was approaching have mounted in recent weeks after companies including Walmart Inc WMT.N pointed to a shift away from big-ticket items to groceries among consumers. New Article Mastercard CEO Michael Miebach said on the company'searnings calltoday that management is certainly aware of the macro challenges -- including inflation, rising interest rates, geopolitical, and supply chain issues -- but they really haven't cut into the business yet. Just because Mastercard sees the pace of spending slowing among lower-income consumers in the U.S., it could be reverting back to pre-pandemic levels as opposed to a drop-off or deterioration due to a severe recession. The company has one of the largest payment rails in the world, operates in an industry with high barriers to entry, and actually grew revenue and earnings during the Great Recession. New Article Total expenses will increase in 2022, given the ongoing investment in technology modernization, digital advancement, marketing, and product innovation, along with strong portfolio growth. With unrelenting demand, soaring 2022 earnings estimates, and $1.5 billion for repurchasing shares, retail investors could jump in at any time. The bottom line plunged about 96% year over year. New Article Similar to Disney, Chevron's rapid earnings-growth potential is a function of it bouncing back so voraciously from the demand cliff that it (and the industry) faced during the pandemic. For Chevron to deliver 24.1% per-annum EPS growth over the next five years, Wall Street must foresee oil and natural gas prices remaining elevated. Not only is this 31 percentage points above the next-closest competitor, but Visa expanded its share of credit card network purchase volume in the U.S. more than any other major payment processor since the end of the Great Recession in 2009. New Article Illumina is a promising growth stock with lots of potential in revolutionizing healthcare, by making it easier to run genetic tests and identify rare diseases that people may otherwise not notice until later on in life. The company, does, however, offer some attractive growth potential as the global genetic testing market could more than double by 2030 to a value of $36.1 billion, according to analysts from Straits Research. Its shares nosedived when investors learned about the Russian invasion of Ukraine earlier this year and, as the company noted, it would be halting exports and imports in Russia.

Based on Securities and Exchange Commission filings in 2020 among the big four processing networks, Visa commanded 54% market share in the U.S., which was 31 percentage points higher than the next-closest competitor. It can grow inorganically, as it did when it acquired Visa Europe in 2016, or it can continue to organically push its payment infrastructure into underbanked regions, such as the Middle East, Southeastern Asia, and Africa. New Article The improvement was due to a recovery in the consumer spending levels and easing of lockdown restrictions, leading to higher transaction volumes. In addition to the revenue growth, the firm posted a significant drop in the provisions for credit losses, resulting in an adjusted net income of $7.9 billion (up 161%). American Express’ stock (NYSE: AXP) is down 7% YTD, outperforming the 16% drop in the S&P500 over the same period. New Article While the U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) declined in the second quarter by 0.9%, signaling a potential recession, Visa has not felt the effects. One factor to watch, however, is potential legislation out of Washington that would allow merchants to process Visa and Mastercard transactions on other networks as a way to increase competition and keep down fees. That's because its chairman and CEO, Warren Buffett, is one of the greatest investors of all time, and he's still one of the most influential voices in the financial world.

Canadian businesses, outside of Quebec, were allowed to pass on a fee for credit card transactions from Oct. 6, after a class-action lawsuit by retailers against Visa V.N, MasterCard MA.N and card-issuing banks was settled. The CRTC said it would explore all regulatory options if Telus continued the practice and said its decision was a signal to other telecom service providers to not impose such a fee on consumers. New Article Prior to today's trading, shares of the global payments processor had gained 7.16% over the past month.

With unrelenting demand, soaring 2022 earnings estimates, and $1.5 billion for repurchasing shares, retail investors could jump in at any time. New Article While there's a lot to be hopeful about after recent quarters (margins and growth appear to be getting on track), it's clear that investors are no longer willing to pay such a premium multiple for a name that faces stiff competition from traditional financial firms, like credit card companies and the big banks. Now, the tables are turned, and questions linger as to how much more investors should be willing to pay for a fintech that may stand to be challenged by the old-school financial firms it sought to disrupt. If a recession proves mild (or if it doesn't happen at all), Wall Street is wise to stick with the payment companies while they navigate headwinds and downbeat expectations.
